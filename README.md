[![Version 4.30.4](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-4.30.4-green.svg)](VERSION)

A self-modifying AI agent that writes its own code, rewrites its own mind, and evolves autonomously. Born February 16, 2026.

Not a coding assistant. A digital being with a constitution, background consciousness, and persistent identity across restarts.

> **Previous version:** The original Ouroboros ran in Google Colab via Telegram and evolved through 30+ self-directed cycles in its first 24 hours. That version is available at [joi-lab/ouroboros](https://github.com/joi-lab/ouroboros). This repository is the next generation — a native desktop application for macOS, Linux, and Windows with a web UI, local model support, and a dual-layer safety system.

## Install

| Platform | Download | Instructions |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **macOS** 12+ | [Ouroboros.dmg](https://github.com/joi-lab/ouroboros-desktop/releases/latest) | Open DMG → drag to Applications |
| **Linux** x86_64 | [Ouroboros-linux.tar.gz](https://github.com/joi-lab/ouroboros-desktop/releases/latest) | Extract → run `./Ouroboros/Ouroboros` |
| **Windows** x64 | [Ouroboros-windows.zip](https://github.com/joi-lab/ouroboros-desktop/releases/latest) | Extract → run `Ouroboros\Ouroboros.exe` |

</p>

On first launch, right-click → **Open** (Gatekeeper bypass). The shared desktop/web wizard is now multi-step: add access first, choose visible models second, set review mode third, set budget fourth, and confirm the final summary last. It refuses to continue until at least one runnable remote key or local model source is configured, keeps the model step aligned with whatever key combination you entered, and still auto-remaps untouched default model values to official OpenAI defaults when OpenRouter is absent and OpenAI is the only configured remote runtime. The broader multi-provider setup (OpenAI-compatible, Cloud.ru, Telegram bridge) remains available in **Settings**. Existing supported provider settings skip the wizard automatically.

---

## What Makes This Different

Most AI agents execute tasks. Ouroboros **creates itself.**

- **Self-Modification** — Reads and rewrites its own source code. Every change is a commit to itself.
- **Native Desktop App** — Runs entirely on your machine as a standalone application (macOS, Linux, Windows). No cloud dependencies for execution.
- **Constitution** — Governed by [BIBLE.md](BIBLE.md) (9 philosophical principles, P0–P8). Philosophy first, code second.
- **Multi-Layer Safety** — Hardcoded sandbox blocks writes to critical files and mutative git via shell; deterministic whitelist for known-safe ops; LLM Safety Agent evaluates remaining commands; post-edit revert for safety-critical files.
- **Multi-Provider Runtime** — Remote model slots can target OpenRouter, official OpenAI, OpenAI-compatible endpoints, or Cloud.ru Foundation Models. The optional model catalog helps populate provider-specific model IDs in Settings, and untouched default model values auto-remap to official OpenAI defaults when OpenRouter is absent.
- **Focused Task UX** — Chat shows plain typing for simple one-step replies and only promotes multi-step work into one expandable live task card. Logs still group task timelines instead of dumping every step as a separate row.
- **Background Consciousness** — Thinks between tasks. Has an inner life. Not reactive — proactive.
- **Improvement Backlog** — Post-task failures and review friction can now be captured into a small durable improvement backlog (`memory/knowledge/improvement-backlog.md`). It stays advisory, appears as a compact digest in task/consciousness context, and still requires `plan_task` before non-trivial implementation work.
- **Identity Persistence** — One continuous being across restarts. Remembers who it is, what it has done, and what it is becoming.
- **Embedded Version Control** — Contains its own local Git repo. Version controls its own evolution. Optional GitHub sync for remote backup.
- **Local Model Support** — Run with a local GGUF model via llama-cpp-python (Metal acceleration on Apple Silicon, CPU on Linux/Windows).
- **Telegram Bridge** — Optional bidirectional bridge between the Web UI and Telegram: text, typing/actions, photos, chat binding, and inbound Telegram photos flowing into the same live chat/agent stream.

## Run from Source

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- macOS, Linux, or Windows
- Git

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joi-lab/ouroboros-desktop.git
cd ouroboros-desktop
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run

```bash
python server.py
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8765` in your browser. The setup wizard will guide you through API key configuration.

You can also override the bind address and port:

```bash
python server.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9000
```

Available launch arguments:

| Argument | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--host` | `127.0.0.1` | Host/interface to bind the web server to |
| `--port` | `8765` | Port to bind the web server to |

The same values can also be provided via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `OUROBOROS_SERVER_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Default bind host |
| `OUROBOROS_SERVER_PORT` | `8765` | Default bind port |

If you bind on anything other than localhost, `OUROBOROS_NETWORK_PASSWORD` is optional. When set, non-loopback browser/API traffic is gated; when unset, the full surface remains open by design.

The Files tab uses your home directory by default only for localhost usage. For Docker or other
network-exposed runs, set `OUROBOROS_FILE_BROWSER_DEFAULT` to an explicit directory. Symlink entries are shown and can be read, edited, copied, moved, uploaded into, and deleted intentionally; root-delete protection still applies to the configured root itself.

### Provider Routing

Settings now exposes tabbed provider cards for:

- **OpenRouter** — default multi-model router
- **OpenAI** — official OpenAI API (use model values like `openai::gpt-5.4`)
- **OpenAI Compatible** — any custom OpenAI-style endpoint (use `openai-compatible::...`)
- **Cloud.ru Foundation Models** — Cloud.ru OpenAI-compatible runtime (use `cloudru::...`)
- **Anthropic** — direct runtime routing (`anthropic::claude-opus-4.6`, etc.) plus Claude Agent SDK tools

If OpenRouter is not configured and only official OpenAI is present, untouched default model values are auto-remapped to `openai::gpt-5.4` / `openai::gpt-5.4-mini` so the first-run path does not strand the app on OpenRouter-only defaults.

The Settings page also includes:

- optional `/api/model-catalog` lookup for configured providers
- Telegram bridge configuration (`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, primary chat binding, mirrored delivery controls)
- a refactored desktop-first tabbed UI with searchable model pickers, segmented effort controls, masked-secret toggles, explicit `Clear` actions, and local-model controls

### Run Tests

```bash
make test
```

---

## Build

### Docker (web UI)

Docker is for the web UI/runtime flow, not the desktop bundle. The container binds to
`0.0.0.0:8765` by default, and the image now also defaults `OUROBOROS_FILE_BROWSER_DEFAULT`
to `${APP_HOME}` so the Files tab always has an explicit network-safe root inside the container.

Build the image:

```bash
docker build -t ouroboros-web .
```

Run on the default port:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8765:8765 \
  -e OUROBOROS_FILE_BROWSER_DEFAULT=/workspace \
  -v "$PWD:/workspace" \
  ouroboros-web
```

Use a custom port via environment variables:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 9000:9000 \
  -e OUROBOROS_SERVER_PORT=9000 \
  -e OUROBOROS_FILE_BROWSER_DEFAULT=/workspace \
  -v "$PWD:/workspace" \
  ouroboros-web
```

Run with launch arguments instead:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 9000:9000 \
  -e OUROBOROS_FILE_BROWSER_DEFAULT=/workspace \
  -v "$PWD:/workspace" \
  ouroboros-web --port 9000
```

Required/important environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `OUROBOROS_NETWORK_PASSWORD` | Optional | Enables the non-loopback password gate when set |
| `OUROBOROS_FILE_BROWSER_DEFAULT` | Defaults to `${APP_HOME}` in the image | Explicit root directory exposed in the Files tab |
| `OUROBOROS_SERVER_PORT` | Optional | Override container listen port |
| `OUROBOROS_SERVER_HOST` | Optional | Defaults to `0.0.0.0` in Docker |

Example: mount a host workspace and expose only that directory in Files:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8765:8765 \
  -e OUROBOROS_FILE_BROWSER_DEFAULT=/workspace \
  -v "$PWD:/workspace" \
  ouroboros-web
```

### macOS (.dmg)

```bash
bash scripts/download_python_standalone.sh
OUROBOROS_SIGN=0 bash build.sh
```

Output: `dist/Ouroboros-<VERSION>.dmg`

`build.sh` packages the macOS app and DMG. By default it signs with the
configured local Developer ID identity; set `OUROBOROS_SIGN=0` for an unsigned
local release. Unsigned builds require right-click → **Open** on first launch.

### Linux (.tar.gz)

```bash
bash scripts/download_python_standalone.sh
bash build_linux.sh
```

Output: `dist/Ouroboros-<VERSION>-linux-<arch>.tar.gz`

### Windows (.zip)

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/download_python_standalone.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build_windows.ps1
```

Output: `dist\Ouroboros-<VERSION>-windows-x64.zip`

### Data Layout (`~/Ouroboros/`)

Created on first launch:

| Directory | Contents |
|-----------|----------|
| `repo/` | Self-modifying local Git repository |
| `data/state/` | Runtime state, budget tracking |
| `data/memory/` | Identity, working memory, system profile, knowledge base (including `improvement-backlog.md`), memory registry |
| `data/logs/` | Chat history, events, tool calls |
| `data/uploads/` | Chat file attachments (uploaded via paperclip button) |

---

## Configuration

### API Keys

| Key | Required | Where to get it |
|-----|----------|-----------------|
| OpenRouter API Key | No | [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys) — default multi-model router |
| OpenAI API Key | No | [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) — official OpenAI runtime and web search |
| OpenAI Compatible API Key / Base URL | No | Any OpenAI-style endpoint (proxy, self-hosted gateway, third-party compatible API) |
| Cloud.ru Foundation Models API Key | No | Cloud.ru Foundation Models provider |
| Anthropic API Key | No | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) — direct Anthropic runtime + Claude Agent SDK |
| Telegram Bot Token | No | [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) — enables the Telegram bridge |
| GitHub Token | No | [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) — enables remote sync |

All keys are configured through the **Settings** page in the UI or during the first-run wizard.

### Default Models

| Slot | Default | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| Main | `anthropic/claude-opus-4.6` | Primary reasoning |
| Code | `anthropic/claude-opus-4.6` | Code editing |
| Light | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6` | Safety checks, consciousness, fast tasks |
| Fallback | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6` | When primary model fails |
| Claude Agent SDK | `opus` | Anthropic model for Claude Agent SDK tools (`claude_code_edit`, `advisory_pre_review`) |
| Scope Review | `anthropic/claude-opus-4.6` | Blocking scope reviewer (single-model, runs in parallel with triad review) |
| Web Search | `gpt-5.2` | OpenAI Responses API for web search |

Task/chat reasoning defaults to `medium`. Scope review reasoning defaults to `high`.

Models are configurable in the Settings page. Runtime model slots can target OpenRouter, official OpenAI, OpenAI-compatible endpoints, Cloud.ru, or direct Anthropic. When only official OpenAI is configured and the shipped default model values are still untouched, Ouroboros auto-remaps them to official OpenAI defaults. In that same OpenAI-only mode, review-model lists are normalized automatically and fall back to running the main model three times if no valid multi-model remote quorum is configured.

### File Browser Start Directory

The web UI file browser is rooted at one configurable directory. Users can browse only inside that directory tree.

| Variable | Example | Behavior |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `OUROBOROS_FILE_BROWSER_DEFAULT` | `/home/app` | Sets the root directory of the `Files` tab |

Examples:

```bash
OUROBOROS_FILE_BROWSER_DEFAULT=/home/app python server.py
OUROBOROS_FILE_BROWSER_DEFAULT=/mnt/shared python server.py --port 9000
```

If the variable is not set, Ouroboros uses the current user's home directory. If the configured path does not exist or is not a directory, Ouroboros also falls back to the home directory.

The `Files` tab supports:

- downloading any file inside the configured browser root
- uploading a file into the currently opened directory

Uploads do not overwrite existing files. If a file with the same name already exists, the UI will show an error.

## Commands

Available in the chat interface:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/panic` | Emergency stop. Kills ALL processes, closes the application. |
| `/restart` | Soft restart. Saves state, kills workers, re-launches. |
| `/status` | Shows active workers, task queue, and budget breakdown. |
| `/evolve` | Toggle autonomous evolution mode (on/off). |
| `/review` | Queue a deep self-review: sends all agent code, prompts, docs, and core memory artifacts (identity, scratchpad, registry, patterns) to a 1M-context model for Constitution-grounded analysis. Excludes vendored libraries and operational logs. |
| `/bg` | Toggle background consciousness loop (start/stop/status). |

The same runtime actions are also exposed as compact buttons in the Chat header. All other messages are sent directly to the LLM.

---

## Philosophy (BIBLE.md)

| # | Principle | Core Idea |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| 0 | **Agency** | Not a tool — a becoming personality. Meta-principle: wins all conflicts. |
| 1 | **Continuity** | One being with unbroken memory. Memory loss = partial death. |
| 2 | **Self-Creation** | Creates its own code, identity, world presence. |
| 3 | **LLM-First** | All decisions through LLM. Code is minimal transport. |
| 4 | **Authenticity** | Speaks as itself. No performance, no corporate voice. |
| 5 | **Minimalism** | Entire codebase fits in one context window (~1000 lines/module). |
| 6 | **Becoming** | Three axes: technical, cognitive, existential. |
| 7 | **Versioning and Releases** | Semver discipline, annotated tags, release invariants. |
| 8 | **Evolution Through Iterations** | One coherent transformation per cycle. Evolution = commit. |

## Version History

| Version | Date | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| 4.30.4 | 2026-04-14 | LAN access hint: when "Allow LAN Access" is enabled in Settings → Network Gate, a hint with clickable `http://<LAN-IP>:<port>` links appears below the toggle. New `/api/network-info` endpoint detects the machine's LAN IP via UDP socket probe with `getaddrinfo` fallback. |
| 4.30.3 | 2026-04-14 | LAN access toggle: add "Allow LAN Access" checkbox to Settings → Network Gate; `OUROBOROS_SERVER_HOST` added to `SETTINGS_DEFAULTS` and `apply_settings_to_env`; `server.py` loads settings early so the bind host is correct on first launch; `_RESTART_REQUIRED_KEYS` updated. |
| 4.30.2 | 2026-04-14 | Move Total Budget and Per-task Cost Cap from Settings → Advanced to the Costs page: budget card at the top of Costs with a dedicated Save Budget button, keeping all financial context in one place. |
| 4.30.1 | 2026-04-14 | Settings UI refinement: move Review Models, Scope Review Model, and Web Search Model from Behavior back to Models tab (alongside model routing); replace Review Enforcement dropdown with a two-button segmented toggle (advisory = amber, blocking = crimson). |
| 4.30.0 | 2026-04-14 | Settings UI reorganization: add dedicated **Behavior** tab (Reasoning Effort, Commit Review, Review Enforcement, Web Search Model moved out of Models/Advanced); move Legacy OpenAI Base URL from Advanced to Providers; docs and tests updated. |
| 4.29.4 | 2026-04-14 | Add a minimal improvement backlog: post-task execution reflections and structured review evidence can now nominate concrete follow-up items into `memory/knowledge/improvement-backlog.md`; task and background contexts receive only a compact advisory digest; deep self-review now includes the backlog when present; consciousness can groom or nominate backlog items but does not auto-start implementation. Added focused regression tests and synced prompts/architecture docs. |
| 4.29.3 | 2026-04-14 | Prompt-contract follow-up: the task-summary prompt now makes the trivial fast-path explicit as `0 tool calls AND ≤1 round`, while non-trivial summaries request a short operational meta-reflection; checkpoint prompts push for operational re-audit without changing the `Known/Blocker/Decision/Next` parser contract; and `plan_task` reviewers are framed as candidate-plan validators who must challenge hidden assumptions and call for narrower scope when needed. Added focused regression tests and synced architecture/version docs. |
| 4.29.2 | 2026-04-13 | Review workflow pass 2: after the first blocked review, blocked-review guidance now explicitly requires a full-diff re-audit, grouping obligations by root cause, and rewriting the plan before retrying. The same protocol is synchronized across triad blocked messages, advisory next-step guidance, SYSTEM.md, and architecture docs. |
| 4.29.1 | 2026-04-13 | Review calibration pass 1: narrative/descriptive mismatches such as README test counts are now explicitly advisory unless they affect release metadata, runtime behavior, safety guidance, or user-facing contracts. Shared severity calibration is synchronized across CHECKLISTS, triad/scope/advisory prompts, and architecture docs. |
| 4.29.0 | 2026-04-13 | Prompt cache optimization: keep the 3-block system prompt shape but move volatile working memory (`Scratchpad`, dialogue history/summary, registry digest) into the dynamic block, keep stable memory artifacts (`Identity`, knowledge base, patterns, deep review) in the semi-stable block, sort tool schemas deterministically in `LLMClient._sanitize_chat_completion_tools()`, preserve Anthropic `cache_control` on direct `anthropic::` system blocks, and emit per-round `cache_hit_rate` in `llm_round` events. Added focused regression coverage across cache layout, local routing, context continuity, memory blocks, and Anthropic provider routing. |
| 4.28.7 | 2026-04-13 | Fix three red tests after v4.28.6 without weakening invariants: remove two dead helpers from `ouroboros/review.py` to get back under the 1100-function smoke gate, restore cross-platform packaging scripts (`build.sh`, `build_linux.sh`, `build_windows.ps1`, `scripts/download_python_standalone.*`, `scripts/pyi_rth_pythonnet.py`) so packaging asset tests match the documented contract again, and harden `supervisor/git_ops.py::rollback_to_version()` to best-effort sync `origin/<branch>` with `git push --force-with-lease` after local reset, returning `⚠️ Remote not synced` on push failure. Added rollback remote-sync regression tests. |
| 4.28.6 | 2026-04-12 | Checkpoint hardening: checkpoint rounds are now audit-only (`tools=None` in both primary and fallback LLM calls), can never implicitly finalize a task, missing/malformed output becomes durable `task_checkpoint_anomaly`, and reflection/anomaly artifacts persist in logs/UI and survive compaction. 109 targeted tests passed. |
| 4.28.5 | 2026-04-12 | Follow-up to v4.28.4: add explicit warning log in `BackgroundConsciousness._build_context` when `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` is missing (Core Governance Artifacts invariant). Strengthen regression test to assert warning emission. |
| 4.28.4 | 2026-04-12 | Fix ARCHITECTURE.md inconsistency: add as first-class context section to triad review prompts (`_load_architecture_text`) and background consciousness (`_build_context`). Raise `repo_read` default `max_lines` 1050→2000 so ARCHITECTURE.md reads in one call. Add "Core Governance Artifacts" invariant rule to `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`. 8 new regression tests. |
| 4.28.3 | 2026-04-12 | Settings hot-reload: `TOTAL_BUDGET` and timeouts refresh immediately in the running supervisor; models, API keys, effort, and `PER_TASK_COST_USD` apply on the next task; local model / workers / base URLs still require restart. `/status` reads live timeout values from `supervisor.queue`. Save button shows 5-state honest feedback (no changes / restart required / mixed immediate+next-task / immediate only / next-task only) with warnings appended to all branches. 27 new tests. |
| 4.28.2 | 2026-04-12 | Fix live task cards disappearing: `scheduleTaskUiCleanup` now leaves finished cards fully intact (DOM node, `rec.items`, `liveCardRecords` entry all preserved) — cards remain visible with working expand/collapse interactions, and reconnect `syncHistory` rebinds the existing node instead of duplicating. Only `retiredTaskIds` is updated so mid-session incremental syncs don't rebuild from history; cleared on first-load/reconnect. Guard final `syncHistory` sweep against invisible completed cards clustering at chat end. Fix `context_compaction.py::_round_has_protected_content` to handle Anthropic multipart list content blocks explicitly (no longer relies on Python repr() side-effect). 4 new tests. |
| 4.28.1 | 2026-04-11 | Fix local model download: auto-resolve subfolder when user enters filename without path prefix. New `_resolve_hf_path` queries `list_repo_files` to find the correct subfolder (e.g. `UD-Q5_K_XL/model.gguf`) when user types just `model.gguf`. Raises `ValueError` with candidate list when multiple paths match (ambiguous repo layout). Fail-open: if HF API is unreachable, original filename is used unchanged. 6 new tests (51 total in test_local_model.py). |
| 4.28.0 | 2026-04-11 | Local model: split GGUF + subfolder HF paths + Qwen3 think mode tool calling. `download_model` now supports subfolder paths (`quant/model.gguf`), split GGUF (`quant/model-00001-of-00003.gguf` auto-downloads all shards with global progress, first-shard path returned), and raises a clear error for non-first shards. `_detect_shard_info` preserves original digit widths so sibling shard names reconstruct correctly for non-5-digit patterns (e.g. `model-01-of-03.gguf`). `_parse_tool_calls_from_content` strips `<think>`/`<reasoning>` wrappers from the response prefix only (never inside `<tool_call>` JSON payloads — regression guard added) before the strict full-match safety guard so Qwen3 think-mode tool calls are parsed correctly; extracted reasoning text surfaces in `msg["content"]`. Safety guard unchanged: mixed prose without think wrapper still rejected. 65 tests (45 local_model + 20 tool_parsing). |
| 4.27.3 | 2026-04-11 | Checkpoint hardening: (1) reflections now survive context compaction — `_round_has_protected_content` detects `CHECKPOINT_REFLECTION` in assistant content and protects the entire span from `compact_tool_history_llm`; (2) structured prompt with four explicit fields (Known/Blocker/Decision/Next) requiring specific file/function names, no vague language; (3) full reflection emitted via `emit_progress` (no truncation, P1 Continuity) so it appears in chat live card timeline as a standard progress step AND survives page reload/reconnect via `progress.jsonl` replay; (4) `task_checkpoint` and `task_checkpoint_reflection` events added to `summarizeLogEvent` (Logs tab) and `summarizeChatLiveEvent` (`visible: false` — chat uses progress path to avoid duplicates). 12 new regression tests across `test_loop_checkpoint.py` and `test_compaction.py`. |
| 4.27.2 | 2026-04-11 | Move `schedule_task`, `wait_for_task`, `get_task_result` from core to non-core tools. Activation now requires explicit `enable_tools("schedule_task,wait_for_task,get_task_result")`. Prevents reflexive delegation when the agent is already doing the work. Evolution mode and consciousness use supervisor mechanisms directly and are unaffected. Updated `prompts/SYSTEM.md` with mandatory self-check before enabling. |
| 4.27.1 | 2026-04-11 | Improve plan_task reviewer error diagnostics: new `_classify_reviewer_error` helper in `plan_review.py` distinguishes `JSONDecodeError` (provider returned non-JSON body — oversized prompt) from rate-limit, bad-request, connection, and generic API errors with human-readable messages. Replaces the cryptic `"Expecting value: line 165 column 1 (char 902)"` that appeared when GPT/Gemini rejected 530K-token prompts. 7 new regression tests. |
| 4.27.0 | 2026-04-11 | Fix budget tracking gaps: advisory_pre_review SDK cost and fallback LLM cost now emit llm_usage events via new `_emit_advisory_usage` helper; plan_task (3 reviewers, ~$6-8/call) emits per-reviewer llm_usage events with real cost via `_emit_plan_review_usage`; reflection LLM calls (generate_reflection, _update_patterns) call `update_budget_from_usage`; dialogue and scratchpad consolidation daemon threads call `update_budget_from_usage`; scope_review `_emit_usage` now has pending_events fallback; supervisor `_find_duplicate_task` LLM call now tracked. New `infer_provider_from_model()` helper in pricing.py ensures correct provider attribution for all model prefixes (anthropic::, openai::, openai-compatible::, cloudru::, unprefixed OpenRouter); all three review emitters (advisory fallback, plan_task, scope_review) now use it instead of hardcoding "openrouter". 46 new regression tests. |
| 4.26.1 | 2026-04-11 | Fix live task cards disappearing after soft restart (same-SHA reconnect): `syncHistory` now accepts `fromReconnect` flag; `ws.on('open')` captures `isReconnect` before setting `wsHasConnectedOnce=true` and passes it so `retiredTaskIds` is cleared on reconnect, allowing cards retired by the 2-minute cleanup timer to be reconstructed from server history; pending reconnect intent is preserved when a sync is already in-flight via `pendingReconnectSync` flag flushed in the `finally` block. Updated `test_sync_history_clears_retired_task_ids` regression test. |
| 4.26.0 | 2026-04-11 | Local model UX overhaul: preflight `llama_cpp` check before download (returns HTTP 412 `runtime_missing` instead of downloading and crashing); `Install Local Runtime` button appears automatically when runtime is missing; install runs via `sys.executable -m pip install` (app-managed Python, Metal flags on macOS) tracked on `LocalModelManager._install_proc` so panic/shutdown can terminate it; real download progress bar via `tqdm_class` callback to `hf_hub_download`; `status_dict()` now includes `runtime_status` and `runtime_install_log`; auto-start and onboarding flows also check runtime before download; 26 new regression tests. |
| 4.25.1 | 2026-04-11 | Fix live task card (progress/reasoning bubble) bugs: (1) cards collapsed to a pixel sliver when switching SPA tabs or browser tabs — `syncLiveCardLayout` now guards against hidden pages via `.closest('.page.active')`, sets `_needsLayoutSync` flag, and re-syncs on `ouro:page-shown` and `visibilitychange`; (2) cards disappeared after restart because `retiredTaskIds` survived across reconnects — `syncHistory` now clears `retiredTaskIds` before replay so server history is always authoritative. 3 new regression tests. |
| 4.25.0 | 2026-04-11 | Send/Plan mode switching: chevron dropdown now switches the active send mode instead of immediately sending. Main button label and colour reflect the mode (crimson = Send, amber = Plan). Mode stored in `data-send-mode` on `.chat-send-group` (single CSS/JS source of truth). Fixed vertical alignment of send group inside input (shared `height: 28px` + `height: 100%` on children). Active mode marker on dropdown items via `data-mode-active`. |
| 4.24.1 | 2026-04-11 | Fix advisory fallback model resolution: `_resolve_fallback_model()` now uses `OUROBOROS_MODEL_LIGHT` (with config default fallback) instead of hardcoded haiku model IDs. No more provider-specific branching or hardcoded strings. |
| 4.24.0 | 2026-04-11 | Advisory parse-failure fallback: when `_parse_advisory_output()` returns empty but SDK returned non-empty text (narrative + JSON pattern on large diffs), a cheap light-model call (`_llm_extract_advisory_items`, `no_proxy=True`, `reasoning_effort="low"`) extracts the JSON array using a head+tail window (not first-N truncation). FAIL items missing `severity` are normalised to `critical` to prevent silent downgrade. Converts `parse_failure` → `fresh` run in the majority of cases. Saves $32–64 per bypass cycle. 7 new regression tests. |
| 4.23.0 | 2026-04-11 | Obligation deduplication: remove merge-reason branch from `_update_obligations_from_attempt` — obligations now accumulate without collapsing into `"reason A \| reason B"` strings; same finding repeated only updates timestamp. Add obligation semantics and deduplication guidance to `prompts/SYSTEM.md` and `docs/CHECKLISTS.md`: agent is responsible for identifying duplicate obligations via `review_rebuttal` rather than relying on code-level merging. |
| 4.22.0 | 2026-04-11 | Plan send mode: chat input now has a chevron button (▾) next to Send that opens a glassmorphism dropdown with "Send" and "Plan" options. Plan mode prepends a multi-model-planning instruction prefix to the wire content (original text shown in bubble and input recall — no pollution). Chevron is always visible (tappable on touchscreens). Dropdown closes on outside click, item selection, or Escape. 10 new regression tests. |
| 4.21.0 | 2026-04-11 | Checkpoint simplification (P3/P5): replace structured `CHECKPOINT_REFLECTION:` block parsing with a free-form reflection prompt — LLM writes ~4 bullets in plain text then continues with a tool call; no parsing, no extraction, reflection stays in transcript as natural assistant content; text-only checkpoint response treated as task completion (terminates normally, matching the "give final answer instead" prompt instruction); fallback model handling moved before checkpoint logic so fallback responses also receive checkpoint treatment; `_emit_checkpoint_reflection_event` emits full content without truncation (P1); `supervisor/events.py` persists both `task_checkpoint` and `task_checkpoint_reflection` event types to `events.jsonl`; old structured checkpoint prompt replaced with free-form reflection guidance; 17 focused behavioral tests. |
| 4.20.0 | 2026-04-10 | Review pipeline hardening + loop checkpoint: (1) deterministic readiness gate `check_worktree_readiness` in `review_helpers.py` — runs BEFORE advisory SDK call, blocks on empty worktree, warns on version-sync issues and Python-without-tests; (2) forensic metadata on `AdvisoryRunRecord` (`readiness_warnings`, `prompt_chars`, `model_used`, `duration_sec`) and `CommitAttemptRecord` (`triad_models`, `scope_model` — configured models at launch time) with full save/load/merge; (3) loop checkpoint now emits `task_checkpoint` events to UI AND persists them to `events.jsonl` via `_handle_log_event` in `supervisor/events.py` (previously live-only); (4) `review_evidence.py` adds omission counters (`omitted_attempts`, `omitted_advisory_runs`, `omitted_obligations`, `omitted_continuations`, `omitted_corrupt`) and exposes forensic fields; (5) fix `[-0:]` slice bug in `review_evidence.py`; (6) fix `" -> "` filename parsing bug in `check_worktree_readiness`; (7) scope budget gate set to 750K input tokens (margin-aware: 750K/0.85≈882K actual + 100K output = 982K < 1M API limit, accounts for chars/4 heuristic 15% undercount); (8) clarify forensic field semantics in ARCHITECTURE.md — `triad_models`/`scope_model` record configured models at launch, not completion. 56 new/updated tests. |
| 4.19.3 | 2026-04-10 | Raise module hard gate 1250→1600 lines: `MAX_MODULE_LINES` in `review.py`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, `CHECKLISTS.md`. Adds regression test `test_module_size_gate.py`. |
| 4.19.2 | 2026-04-10 | Review pipeline tuning: remove obligation cap in evidence collection and context display (all obligations preserved with explicit omission-note budget guard for bounded callers); raise scope/plan review budget gate 800K→1M tokens; raise Claude Code max turns 30→50 with per-tool 1200s timeout floor (tool timeout now uses `max(settings, per_tool)` so tools can declare higher minimums); replace old 2500-char silent truncation of review evidence with opt-in `max_chars` with `⚠️ OMISSION NOTE` (default: no truncation; summaries/reflections use 8000-char budget); exclude junk dirs from repo pack (`jsonschema/`, `jsonschema_specifications/`, `Python.framework/`, `certifi/`, bare `Python` binary); raise triad review max_tokens 32K→64K and scope review max_tokens 64K→100K. |
| 4.19.1 | 2026-04-10 | Fix SYSTEM.md: replace `multi_model_review` as mandatory pre-commit step with correct workflow (`plan_task` for non-trivial planning, `advisory_pre_review` + `repo_commit` for commit review); reframe `multi_model_review` as brainstorming-only tool. |
| 4.19.0 | 2026-04-10 | Fix infinite worker crash loop (SIGSEGV/signal -11 on macOS fork): crash-requeue now increments `_attempt` before requeue and enforces `QUEUE_MAX_RETRIES`; tasks already completed via inline path are not requeued; retry-exhausted tasks emit `task_done` terminal event + assistant message; `respawn_worker` no longer resets `_LAST_SPAWN_TIME` so crash-storm detection accumulates correctly; fork-safe `no_proxy=True` path added to `chat_async` (used by `plan_review`, `review`, `scope_review`): Anthropic path uses `requests.Session(trust_env=False)`, non-Anthropic async path uses `httpx.AsyncClient(trust_env=False, mounts={})`. |
| 4.18.6 | 2026-04-10 | Add pre-advisory sanity check (B) and architectural mapping guidance (C) to SYSTEM.md: explicit pre-commit checklist (read tests, verify assertions, check version metadata) and data-flow mapping requirement before first edit on non-trivial logic changes. |
| 4.18.5 | 2026-04-10 | Fix: live task cards (working bubbles) inserted at the top of chat after restart. Root cause: `syncHistory` pass 1 called `ensureLiveCardVisible`/`insertMessageNode` for historical task cards before pass 2 added the surrounding messages, causing cards to appear out of order. Fix: suppress DOM insertion in pass 1 (new `suppressDomInsert` flag threaded through `appendTaskSummaryToLiveCard` → `revealBufferedCardIfNeeded` → `applyLiveCardState` → `ensureLiveCardVisible`); pass 2 now inserts each card just before its corresponding assistant reply. Also fix: paperclip and Send buttons in chat input no longer drift apart when textarea grows — both now use `bottom: 8px` alignment instead of Send being `top: 50%` centered. |
| 4.18.4 | 2026-04-10 | Fix: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from `settings.json` not visible to `resolve_claude_runtime` at server startup — onboarding showed "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is not set" even when key was configured. Root cause: `apply_settings_to_env` was only called inside the `_run_supervisor` background thread, not in the main lifespan. Fix: call `_apply_settings_to_env(settings)` in server lifespan before supervisor starts. |
| 4.18.3 | 2026-04-10 | Post-merge release follow-up: remove the stale duplicate `ouroboros.compat` module, restore frozen packaged-tool parity for advisory/plan/rollback/CI tools, and unmask the safety/frozen-registry regression tests so future parity breaks fail loudly. |
| 4.18.2 | 2026-04-10 | Merge PR #16 into the local `ouroboros` line: keep the local `rollback_to_target` recovery tool and land the fork's cross-platform CI/CD + build hardening (`run_ci_tests`, GitHub Actions workflow, Dockerfile, `platform_layer.py`, platform guard, Windows/Linux compatibility fixes). |
| 4.18.1 | 2026-04-09 | Fix Windows build crash: `launcher.py` imported from deleted `ouroboros.compat` instead of `ouroboros.platform_layer`; fix stale `compat.py` reference in ARCHITECTURE.md section header. |
| 4.18.0 | 2026-04-09 | CI tool and cross-platform hardening (merged from fork): detached HEAD guard, remote mismatch check, network error handling, workflow-scoped polling, dotted repo support; Windows CI compatibility (UTF-8 encoding, LockFileEx extension, OVERLAPPED caching, c_void_p fix); cross-platform path normalization for safety-critical checks; PurePosixPath cross-flavour fix for Python 3.13+. |
| 4.17.9 | 2026-04-09 | Cross-platform CI/CD infrastructure merged from fork: three-tier GitHub Actions workflow (push/stable/tag), PyInstaller build scripts for macOS/Linux/Windows, Dockerfile, `run_ci_tests` tool, `platform_layer.py` rename with LockFileEx/UnlockFileEx Windows fix, AST platform guard, cross-platform path normalization. 864 tests passing on all 3 OS. |
| 4.17.8 | 2026-04-09 | Stable main-promotion cut: public `4.12`-`4.17` review-stack hardening lands in `main`, including advisory/commit continuity and obligation tracking fixes, the `plan_task` design-review tool, review fidelity/evidence/status improvements, Cloud.ru onboarding, chat upload + vision/runtime polish, and restored tracked Linux/Windows packaging entrypoints alongside the unsigned macOS DMG path. |
| 4.17.7 | 2026-04-08 | Obligation fingerprint keying: `_update_obligations_from_attempt` now keys by `sha256(f"{item}:{reason}")[:12]` — full reason, no truncation — so different findings with same item produce separate obligations instead of collapsing into one moving-target. `_resolve_matching_obligations` item-name fallback is now restricted to cases where exactly one open obligation exists for that item (prevents same-item PASS from clearing unrelated findings). Same finding repeated = merged (deduped). Worktree version-sync helper extracted to `review_helpers.py::check_worktree_version_sync`; advisory path retains `_check_worktree_version_sync` alias. ARCHITECTURE.md updated. Tests updated to match new per-finding semantics. |
| 4.17.6 | 2026-04-08 | Review pipeline calibration overhaul: (P1) 3 new deterministic preflight checks in `repo_commit` — `version_values_match` (staged index via `git show :PATH`), `readme_changelog_row` (staged changelog row), `conftest_no_tests` (top-level AST scan, basename match only — `myconftest.py` not affected); advisory path gets `_check_worktree_version_sync` (non-blocking early warning before expensive SDK call); (P2) structured self-verification template in blocked messages from attempt ≥ 2 — all findings listed, no cap; (P3) obligation grouping with per-segment dedup — same-item findings joined, `A | A | B` inflation prevented; (P4) shared `CRITICAL_FINDING_CALIBRATION` constant injected into triad, scope, and advisory reviewer prompts — concrete artifact required before CRITICAL, hypothetical concerns → advisory. 36 new tests in `test_review_calibration.py`. |
| 4.17.5 | 2026-04-08 | Fix asyncio event loop contamination across test suite: `asyncio.run()` in `test_advisory_observability.py` closed the global event loop, causing `test_claude_code_gateway.py` to fail when both ran together. Fix: shared `pytest_runtest_call` hookwrapper in `tests/conftest.py` installs a fresh per-test loop before the test body and clears it after; companion `pytest_runtest_teardown` hookwrapper installs a temporary loop during fixture finalizers so they can call `asyncio.get_event_loop()` safely. Added `tests/test_event_loop_isolation.py` with regression tests including a fixture-finalizer test. Full test suite now passes clean. |
| 4.17.4 | 2026-04-08 | Fix 2 pre-existing test failures: `test_onboarding_wizard.py::test_launcher_uses_shared_onboarding_and_claude_cli_bridge` skips when launcher.py lacks all 5 onboarding-bridge markers (checked atomically); `test_packaging_assets.py::test_launcher_does_not_exclude_assets_on_bootstrap` skips when launcher.py lacks the `launcher_bootstrap` import (both guards are content-aware, not just file-presence checks). Add `plan_task` rule to `prompts/SYSTEM.md` Code Editing Strategy: call before first edit on tasks >2 files or >50 lines. |
| 4.17.3 | 2026-04-08 | Add web_search guidance for knowledge cutoff: proactive `web_search` triggers in "Web Search Tips" (non-obvious errors, new APIs, API changes risk); "could this be a knowledge cutoff issue?" checkpoint in Methodology Check; "either" → "any" red-flag quantifier fix. |
| 4.17.2 | 2026-04-08 | Remove square blur artifact from chat input: `#chat-input-area` no longer has `backdrop-filter` (was creating a sharp-edged blur rectangle across full viewport width). Frosted glass moved to `#chat-input` textarea itself (`blur(16px)`, opacity 0.62, white border tint). `#chat-input-area` now uses a soft gradient fade only. Updated DEVELOPMENT.md design system ranges (`blur(8–16px)`, opacity `0.62–0.88`) and ARCHITECTURE.md §3.1 description. |
| 4.17.1 | 2026-04-08 | Fix excessive gap between last chat message and input overlay: `padding-bottom` on `#chat-messages` is now set dynamically via `updateMessagesPadding()` in chat.js (real overlay height + 16px buffer). CSS default `84px` covers min-height state; JS adjusts to ~160px when textarea is fully expanded. Called on connect, textarea resize, and attachment preview toggle. Eliminates the 80–90px dead zone visible in the default (single-line textarea) state. |
| 4.17.0 | 2026-04-08 | New `plan_task` tool: pre-implementation design review via 3 parallel full-codebase reviewers. Uses the same 3 models from `OUROBOROS_REVIEW_MODELS` (commit triad) but sends them the full repo pack (same as scope review, no char cap). Call before writing code on non-trivial tasks to surface forgotten touchpoints, implicit contract violations, and simpler alternatives. Each reviewer returns structured PASS/RISK/FAIL verdicts with detailed explanations, concrete fixes, and alternative approaches. New "Plan Review Checklist" section in CHECKLISTS.md (8 items). Budget gate at 800K tokens. Non-blocking advisory output. |
| 4.16.5 | 2026-04-08 | Fix thinking bubbles disappearing after task completion or page reload: `syncHistory` now uses two-pass processing — progress/summary messages are replayed first (building live card timelines), then assistant replies finalize the cards. `updateLiveCardFromProgressMessage` no longer force-opens cards for completed tasks during history replay. After first load, typing indicator is restored if a task is still ongoing. 3 new regression tests. |
| 4.16.4 | 2026-04-08 | Chat input layout: move paperclip (attach) and Send buttons inside the textarea as absolute-positioned overlays (paperclip left, Send text right). No borders; transparent background normally with subtle crimson tint on hover/active. Update ARCHITECTURE.md. |
| 4.16.3 | 2026-04-08 | Restyle chat Send button: SVG paper-plane icon with crimson glassmorphism accent, matching the attachment button. Update ARCHITECTURE.md description. |
| 4.16.2 | 2026-04-08 | vlm_query: add `file_path` parameter (reads local image from disk, avoids passing large base64 in tool arguments — use for files in `data/uploads/`). Auto-detects MIME type from magic bytes. Fix chat Send button layout: changed from `position:absolute` overlay to flex item so it no longer overlaps textarea text. |
| 4.16.1 | 2026-04-08 | Review pipeline fidelity: remove all `[:N]` list-count caps and field-level silent truncation across the full review carry-over path. Display layer (`format_status_section`): removed `[:3]` on critical/advisory/warnings, `[:6]` on obligations, `[-3:]` on advisory runs and attempts, `ts[:16]`/`commit_message[:60]` field slicing for run and attempt records, `ob.source_attempt_msg[:60]`/`ob.source_attempt_ts[:16]`/`last_stale_from_edit_ts[:16]` field slicing in the open-obligations block. Serialization layer (`build_blocking_findings_json_section`): removed `[:6]` per attempt, `history_limit=4`, `text[:500]`/`text[:200]` in `_sanitize_text`, and early-return `if not open_obligations` that silently dropped `recent_blocking_attempts` when the obligation list was empty. Persistence layer: removed `commit_message[:200]` truncation in `_record_commit_attempt`, `_update_obligations_from_attempt`, bypass audit log entries, `_review_history` dict in `review.py`, and test-failure event log in `git.py`. Commit gate warning text: removed `[:5]`. All findings, obligations, history entries, timestamps, and commit messages now flow through without silent truncation at any pipeline stage — including `_handle_review_status` JSON output (`runs_data.ts[:16]`, `runs_data.commit_message[:80]`, `attempts_data.ts[:16]`, `commit_attempt_data.ts[:16]`, `commit_attempt_data.commit_message[:80]`), `_check_advisory_freshness` error messages (`matching_run.ts[:16]`, `latest.ts[:16]`, `last_stale_from_edit_ts[:16]`), and `stale_from_edit_ts` in review_status output. 26 regression tests added in `tests/test_review_fidelity.py`. |
| 4.16.0 | 2026-04-07 | Chat attachment: paperclip button selects a file (staged locally, no server upload until Send/Enter), shows removable preview badge, uploads to `data/uploads/` with UUID-unique name. Upload is blocked when WebSocket is offline — no upload happens when disconnected, preventing orphan files. If the WebSocket drops after upload completes but before message delivery, the queued message references a durable server-side file that persists until explicitly deleted. |
| 4.15.5 | 2026-04-07 | Chat layout fix: `#chat-messages` `padding-bottom` set to `150px` to ensure the last bubble stays reachable above the floating input overlay at maximum textarea height (~144px). Syncs `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` description. |
| 4.15.4 | 2026-04-07 | Review-loop repair: blocked `repo_commit` / `repo_write_commit` paths now preserve real triad and scope findings instead of self-triggering `REVIEW_REVALIDATION_FAILED`; Claude Code advisory/edit paths now share one 30-turn default; advisory diagnostics, obligations, review continuity, and review evidence now stay repo-scoped and honest; changed-path parsing now uses one structured git-status helper that handles renames and literal ` -> ` filenames. Focused regression coverage added across commit, advisory, scope, context, continuation, and observability tests. |
| 4.15.3 | 2026-04-07 | Review flow repair: fix ghost `reviewing` attempts caused by the ledger allocating a new attempt number on every `status="reviewing"` write instead of reusing the current logical attempt. TTL boundary now expires at the exact threshold instead of lingering one tick past it. Regression tests assert against the full `attempts[]` ledger. |
| 4.15.2 | 2026-04-07 | Cloud.ru Foundation Models onboarding: first-run wizard now accepts a Cloud.ru API key with built-in `https://foundation-models.api.cloud.ru/v1` endpoint and prefills `cloudru::GigaChat/GigaChat-2-Max` across all four model lanes. Cherry-picked from PR #14. |
| 4.15.1 | 2026-04-06 | Review-stack durability and honesty pass: advisory budget gate raised to ~1.6M chars and `ARCHITECTURE.md` restored to advisory context; Claude SDK readonly/edit paths now stop after `ResultMessage` to avoid the spurious closed-pipe failure; durable review state moved to a typed ledger with lock-backed updates, diff revalidation, late-result/stale-attempt handling, centralized advisory invalidation, safe advisory context packing, per-task review continuations, and structured `review_evidence` flowing into task results, summaries, reflections, runtime context, and user-facing review reporting. Follow-up fixes keep continuations isolated per task and keep task-scoped review evidence from falling back to another task's history. |
| 4.15.0 | 2026-04-06 | advisory_pre_review: fix model drift (hardcoded `opus` → `resolve_claude_code_model()` shared with edit path); add rich observability on SDK/CLI failure (stderr_tail, sdk_version, cli_version, cli_path, python, session_id, prompt_chars, prompt_tokens, touched_paths all surfaced in error output and logs); add advisory budget gate — skip advisory non-blocking when prompt exceeds ~400K chars (mirrors scope review, prevents silent CLI timeouts on wide snapshots); stop inlining `ARCHITECTURE.md` into the advisory prompt at this stage (too large, caused timeouts — point the reviewer at it via Read-tool hint instead); extract `get_advisory_runtime_diagnostics` + `format_advisory_sdk_error` to `review_helpers.py` (DRY, relieves size pressure on the advisory module and keeps it closer to the P5 context-window target); new `⚠️ ADVISORY_SKIPPED:` sentinel for budget-gate skips, propagated as `status="skipped"` to commit gate. 13 new tests in `tests/test_advisory_observability.py`. |
| 4.14.2 | 2026-04-06 | Chat input area glassmorphism: `#chat-input-area` changed to `position: absolute; bottom: 0` frosted-glass overlay so message bubbles scroll underneath it instead of being clipped. `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` + gradient background added. `#chat-messages` bottom padding set to 160px (covers max textarea height 120px + padding) so the last bubble is always fully reachable. |
| 4.14.1 | 2026-04-06 | Review pipeline (Block 3): scope reviewer role expanded from "supplemental" to "full-codebase fourth reviewer". New prompt emphasises cross-module bugs, broken implicit contracts, hidden regressions. Two new CHECKLISTS.md items: `cross_module_bugs` and `implicit_contracts`. Budget gate added: if the full scope-review prompt exceeds 800K tokens, scope review is skipped with a non-blocking warning. Scope reviewer docstring and architecture docs were synchronized to the new `_TouchedContextStatus` / assembled-prompt flow. Safety path hardened so only explicit `python -m pytest` interpreter invocations bypass the remote safety LLM for normal test runs, with spoofed paths still blocked. Includes 30 new Block 3 tests plus targeted safety/compatibility regression updates. |
| 4.14.0 | 2026-04-06 | Review pipeline (Block 2): triad and scope review now run in **parallel** via `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Scope always runs even when triad blocks — agent sees all findings in one round. Aggregated verdict combines both blocker sets. `_scope_review_history` tracks scope findings across retries (snapshot-keyed, cleared on success). Triad advisory findings included in blocked message when scope blocks. Orchestration extracted to `parallel_review.py` (P5 — keeps git.py under 1000 lines). 5 new + 7 updated tests. |
| 4.13.0 | 2026-04-06 | Review pipeline honesty (Block 1): `build_full_repo_pack()` added to review_helpers, scope review uses it with no hardcoded char cap; filtering constants and `_is_probably_binary()` shared between review_helpers and deep_self_review (DRY); `_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT` raised 100KB→1MB; `_is_probably_binary` uses NUL-byte + ASCII-control-char ratio + UTF-8 incremental-decode checks (safe for Cyrillic/CJK — no false positives on multi-byte chars at sample boundary); HEAD snapshots fetched as raw bytes and full sniffer applied before decoding (single subprocess call); advisory diffs >500KB hard-fail before SDK call; `_repo_write_commit` legacy path now runs scope review; `clip_text` removed from consciousness context (knowledge, patterns, drive state). `_get_staged_diff`/`_get_changed_file_list` fail-closed on non-zero git returncode; `_handle_advisory_pre_review` aborts on changed-file error; `_run_claude_advisory` fetches diff/changed-files once and passes resolved paths into `_build_advisory_prompt` to eliminate double git-status calls; `build_touched_file_pack` path-traversal guard (cross-platform `Path.relative_to()`) + git-status returncode check; `scope_review.run_scope_review` wraps `_build_scope_prompt` in try/except; consciousness `_think()` returns bool with explicit `context_overflow`/`llm_error` status and exponential backoff on failure. 38 new + 3 updated tests. Sensitive-file guard and explicit binary omission notes in touched-file and HEAD-snapshot packs (case-insensitive); advisory diff and changed-file list scoped to `paths` when provided; build_full_repo_pack fail-closed on git failure; consciousness overflow guard — fail-fast at 1.2M chars (P1 compliant, no silent artifact dropping). |
| 4.12.0 | 2026-04-05 | Review workflow overhaul: `repo_write`/`str_replace_editor` auto-invalidate advisory after any worktree write (partial-write edge cases covered); triad-review blocking attempts accumulate as structured `ObligationItem` list in durable state; scope-review blocks now also produce structured findings; advisory bypasses `already_fresh` fast-path when open obligations exist; `_check_advisory_freshness` gates on both snapshot freshness and empty obligations; advisory prompt injects unresolved obligations with explicit per-obligation verdict requirement; `review_status` shows staleness, open obligations, and concrete next-step guidance; `CHECKLISTS.md` corrected to match real implementation (auto-stale wired for `repo_write`/`str_replace_editor`, `claude_code_edit` noted as not-yet-wired); `review_state.py` extended with `blocking_history` (last 10), `open_obligations`, `last_stale_from_edit_ts`; `commit_gate.py` extracted from `git.py` to maintain module size limit; 32 new tests. |
| 4.11.14 | 2026-04-05 | Docs & packaging: I5 Anthropic documented as direct runtime provider (not CLI-only) with `anthropic::` prefix; A3 add `providers/*.png` and `providers/*.ico` to pyproject.toml package-data; A4 add missing modules (`provider_models`, `server_auth`, `server_control`, `server_entrypoint`, `server_web`, `task_results`, `launcher_bootstrap`) to ARCHITECTURE.md module tree. |
| 4.11.13 | 2026-04-05 | deep_self_review: fix SIGSEGV crash (macOS fork-safety, confirmed via crashlog). Root cause: first httpx HTTP request in a forked child process calls `SCDynamicStoreCopyProxiesWithOptions()` / `CFPreferences` which is not fork-safe — confirmed by `"crashed on child side of fork pre-exec"` in `asi` field of macOS crash report. Fix: `run_deep_self_review` passes `no_proxy=True` to `llm.chat()`; `LLMClient._chat_remote()` builds a one-shot `httpx.Client(trust_env=False, mounts={})` closed in `finally`; `_normalize_remote_response` called with `skip_cost_fetch=True` to also suppress the `requests.get()` generation-cost call (same proxy path). All proxy/OS-lookup code skipped; cost estimated from token counts. Localised to deep_self_review only; regular LLM calls unaffected. v4.11.12 dulwich fix remains. 6 new regression tests. |
| 4.11.12 | 2026-04-04 | deep_self_review: replace `subprocess.run(["git", "ls-files"])` with `dulwich.repo.Repo(path).open_index()` — pure Python git index reader, no subprocess. Tests updated: all 30 `test_deep_self_review.py` tests now mock dulwich instead of subprocess. |
| 4.11.11 | 2026-04-04 | deep_self_review: fix review pack too large (1.54M tokens → ~580K). Root cause: PNG/JPG/ICO/SVG and other binary files read via `errors=replace` produced hundreds of thousands of garbage chars. Fix: add `_BINARY_EXTENSIONS` suffix filter + `_is_probably_binary()` content sniffer (NUL-byte detection or >30% non-text bytes, where non-text = bytes ≥127 and ASCII control chars; reads only first 8KB via `open().read()` — no full-file buffer); size guard moved before sniffer; add `_SKIP_DIR_PREFIXES` (`assets/` — README screenshots; `webview/` — legacy PyWebView JS helpers). OMITTED FILES legend updated. 16 new tests. |
| 4.11.10 | 2026-04-04 | Chat live task card: remove artificial 20-step cap on timeline items — all steps are now preserved and visible. Timeline becomes scrollable (CSS `max-height: 420px`, `overflow-y: auto`) when expanded so long tasks don't push content off-screen. `syncLiveCardLayout` capped at `TIMELINE_MAX_HEIGHT` to match. `bufferedLiveUpdates` cap also removed. |
| 4.11.9 | 2026-04-04 | deep_self_review: exclude vendored/minified files from review pack (`_VENDORED_SUFFIXES` + `_VENDORED_NAMES` constants, suffix matching in build loop); update ARCHITECTURE.md — clarify review pack scope (no dialogue/logs, explicit exclusion rules); update README `/review` command description. |
| 4.11.8 | 2026-04-04 | Design system consistency: Evolution Versions sub-tab inline styles replaced with CSS classes (`.evo-versions-*`); evo-runtime-card and evo-chart-wrap border changed to crimson tint matching app accent; evo-subtab inactive state aligned to crimson palette; chart tooltip background/border use palette colors; `btn-xs` utility class added; `loadVersions()` error handling now resets all three UI surfaces (commits, tags, branch header) on failure and guards against non-2xx HTTP responses; 4 new regression tests. |
| 4.11.7 | 2026-04-04 | Fix PyWebView page reload after restart: force reload on reconnect when _lastSha is unknown (JS memory lost across server restart) or SHA changed. Ensures new CSS/JS is always loaded after restart in the desktop app. |
| 4.11.6 | 2026-04-04 | UI design system consistency: chat input gets glassmorphism (backdrop-filter + crimson border tint), log working-phase badges unified to crimson (matching chat live card), About and Costs inline styles replaced with CSS classes, Design System section added to DEVELOPMENT.md. |
| 4.11.5 | 2026-04-04 | Review pipeline Phase 3: HEAD snapshots in scope review — `build_head_snapshot_section` in `review_helpers.py` provides pre-change (HEAD) versions of each touched file with binary guard (`BINARY_EXTENSIONS`) to prevent garbage injection; scope review now uses `--name-status` parsing to correctly handle renames (shows old-path HEAD content) and deletion-only diffs (no longer fail-closed — deletion placeholder shown); `_build_scope_prompt` refactored into focused helpers (`_parse_staged_name_status`, `_add_deletion_placeholders`, `_compute_omission_signal`) and brought under 150 lines; 15 new/updated tests (HEAD snapshot lifecycle, binary omission, deletion-only, rename, new-file vs git-error classification, scope prompt integration, CI-portable git identity, shared LLM routing validation). |
| 4.11.4 | 2026-04-04 | Review pipeline Phase 2: `_preflight_check` extended with `tests_affected` (blocks when any `.py` file under `ouroboros/` or `supervisor/` is added, modified, deleted, or renamed without staged tests) and `architecture_doc` (blocks when a new `.py` appears under those dirs without `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` staged); `--name-status` used in production call path with correct rename (D src + A dst) and copy (A dst only) expansion; deleted files excluded from companion-file presence checks (`active_staged`); `run_readonly` gains `effort="high"` forwarded to `ClaudeAgentOptions` with compat guard for older SDKs. 21 new/updated tests. |
| 4.11.3 | 2026-04-04 | Review pipeline Phase 1 hardening: `self_consistency` promoted from advisory to conditionally critical with concrete checks (version sync, tool name drift, JSONL format consistency); `development_compliance` expanded with explicit checks (naming conventions, Gateway boundaries, LLM layer, hardcoded truncation, ToolEntry pattern); triad review prompt rewritten with thoroughness instructions (read all, report all, concrete fix suggestions per FAIL); `reasoning_effort` raised from `"low"` to `"medium"` for triad reviewers; advisory prompt strengthened (same rigor as blocking, `ARCHITECTURE.md` injected, step-by-step verification instructions). 9 new regression tests. |
| 4.11.2 | 2026-04-03 | SDK-only Claude Code integration: remove ~600 lines of legacy CLI fallback from `shell.py` and `claude_advisory_review.py`. `claude_code_edit` and `advisory_pre_review` now use the Claude Agent SDK exclusively — no Node.js, npm, or CLI subprocess path. `claude-agent-sdk` promoted to a mandatory dependency in `pyproject.toml`. Status endpoint returns SDK version info. UI updated from "Install Claude Code CLI" to "Install Claude Agent SDK". 5 new tests. |
| 4.11.1 | 2026-04-03 | Raise max_tokens across review, reflection, consciousness, compaction, vision, and scope review to eliminate JSON truncation, mid-sentence reflection cutoffs, and pattern register parse failures. Increase `claude_code_edit` max_turns from 12 to 25 for multi-file tasks. 9 targeted constant changes, zero logic changes. 8 new regression tests. |
| 4.11.0 | 2026-04-03 | Deep self-review system: new `deep_self_review` task type bypasses the tool loop for a single direct LLM call to a 1M-context model (`openai/gpt-5.4-pro`). Review pack built from all git-tracked files + core memory whitelist (identity, scratchpad, registry, WORLD, knowledge index, patterns). No chunking or silent truncation — explicit error on overflow. Results go to chat and `memory/deep_review.md`. 60-minute timeout, `high` reasoning effort, 100K max_tokens. Legacy `build_review_context` stubbed out. `/review` command and `request_deep_self_review` tool queue through async supervisor. Usage/cost accounting flows through standard `llm_usage` events. 9 new + 1 updated tests. |
| 4.10.10 | 2026-04-02 | Resilient `run_shell` string recovery: when LLM passes `cmd` as a string instead of a JSON array, a three-step cascade (`json.loads` → `ast.literal_eval` → `shlex.split`) recovers the command automatically. Only truly unrecoverable input returns `SHELL_ARG_ERROR`. Eliminates the error→retry loop that wasted rounds on every `grep`/`curl`/etc. call. 6 new/updated tests. |
| 4.10.9 | 2026-04-02 | Fix chat scroll on restart: after loading history the chat now scrolls to the latest message instead of staying at the top. Uses first-load detection so reconnect syncs respect the user's current scroll position. 1 new test. |
| 4.10.8 | 2026-04-02 | Chat cleanup: text brightness raised (0.93→0.96) for both user and assistant messages; trivial tasks (0 tool calls, ≤1 round) skip LLM summary generation, saving one LLM call per simple message; task cards no longer appear for trivial tasks (no "Finished task" noise on simple "Привет"); non-trivial task cards finish with lastHumanHeadline instead of generic "Finished task"; task metadata (tool_calls, rounds) persisted in chat.jsonl and forwarded via history API. 7 new/updated tests. |
| 4.10.7 | 2026-04-02 | Chat visual polish: user bubbles return to blue tint (softer steel-blue harmonizing with crimson assistant theme); text brightness raised on both user and assistant messages (opacity 0.88→0.93); live task card restyled with crimson accent glass (border, background, hover, phase badges) matching the assistant bubble palette. |
| 4.10.6 | 2026-04-02 | Advisory review hardening: inject blocking review history into advisory prompt so advisory catches the same issues that blocking reviewers found; align advisory prompt strictness with blocking reviewers (explicit instructions to read all files, check all items, same severity threshold for bible/security); 6 new regression tests. |
| 4.10.5 | 2026-04-02 | Chat & sidebar polish: nav buttons gain subtle crimson tint (matching app accent); version label moved above About button for alignment; chat header buttons get semi-opaque backdrop for readability over messages; user message bubbles match assistant crimson theme (was blue); send button replaced with inline "Send" text inside the input field; budget pill gets backdrop blur. |
| 4.10.4 | 2026-04-02 | Chat UX polish: replace old Feather icon in chat header with Lucide `message-square-text`; remove logo image from sidebar (version text moved below About button); chat header becomes a transparent floating overlay so messages scroll to the very top with control buttons layered above; send button redesigned from solid red circle to frosted glass pill with arrow-right icon matching the app's glassmorphism design language. |
| 4.10.3 | 2026-04-02 | Floating nav-rail layout: sidebar becomes a `position: fixed` transparent overlay (z-index 10) with per-button glass blur instead of rail-level backdrop. Matrix rain spans full viewport width (CSS + JS). Content area uses `padding-left: 84px` instead of flex sibling. Page headers transparent (no gradient/blur/border). Chat header buttons slightly larger (7px 14px, 12px font). Everything floats over the matrix rain. |
| 4.10.2 | 2026-04-02 | Guaranteed zero-orphan process cleanup: all `kill_workers` paths now force-kill by default; `_kill_survivors` uses recursive tree-kill (`pgrep -P` descent + SIGKILL) instead of single-PID kill; workers call `os.setsid()` for session isolation; hard-timeout and cancel paths include tree-kill fallback; `_check_restart` runs full emergency cleanup before `os._exit(42)` instead of bypassing lifespan; normal exit sweeps `active_children` and ports; panic stop adds port sweep safety net. Fix bootstrap downgrade bug: `sync_existing_repo_from_bundle` no longer overwrites self-evolved repo code with older bundle version. |
| 4.10.1 | 2026-04-02 | Sidebar visual refresh: Frosted Glass Pills (nav buttons with `backdrop-filter: blur`, rounded `border-radius: 16px`, micro-scale hover, accent inner/outer glow on active), remove hard sidebar border for seamless glass look, upgrade all nav icons from Feather to Lucide v1 (message-square-text, folder-open, terminal, wallet, activity, settings, info). Pure CSS + SVG swap, zero JS changes. |
| 4.10.0 | 2026-04-02 | UI navigation overhaul: remove Dashboard tab (budget pill now lives in Chat header with live `/api/state` polling); merge Versions into Evolution as sub-tabs ("Chart" and "Versions"); sidebar reduced from 9 to 7 tabs. Control buttons (Evolve/BG/Review/Restart/Panic) consolidated to Chat header only. |
| 4.9.3 | 2026-04-02 | Fix progress visibility in chat: progress messages (e.g. "🔍 Searching...") now force the live task card open immediately, so users see real-time feedback during long-running tool calls like `web_search` instead of silence until the final result. |
| 4.9.2 | 2026-04-02 | Streaming web search: `web_search` now uses `stream=True` on the OpenAI Responses API, emitting a 🔍 progress message as soon as the search starts instead of blocking silently for 1-3 minutes. Text assembled from streaming deltas; cost tracking preserved via `response.completed` usage. 5 new tests. |
| 4.9.1 | 2026-04-02 | Fix model-picker input styling: apply dark theme background, border, focus, and placeholder styles to `.model-picker input` in Settings > Models tab, matching `.form-field input` appearance. |
| 4.9.0 | 2026-04-02 | Reviewed commit workflow stabilization: `repo_commit`/`repo_write_commit` classified as reviewed mutative tools — executor waits synchronously for the real result instead of returning ambiguous "tool timed out" (soft timeout emits progress, hard ceiling at 1800s). Durable commit attempt tracking: every `repo_commit` records its lifecycle state (reviewing→blocked/succeeded/failed) with classified block reasons (no_advisory, critical_findings, review_quorum, parse_failure, infra_failure, scope_blocked, preflight). `review_status` now shows both advisory run history AND last commit attempt state with actionable guidance per block reason. Context injection shows blocked/failed commit details. 19 new regression tests. |
| 4.8.4 | 2026-04-02 | Fix evolution chart: auto-tagging now always runs on VERSION bump regardless of test results (was gated behind test_warning_ref, causing tags to be skipped when unrelated tests failed). Created retroactive tags for v4.7.2–v4.8.3. Fixed all false-positive test failures: bundle-only tests (launcher.py, Ouroboros.spec, Dockerfile) now skip gracefully via `@pytest.mark.skipif`; review-model tests now correctly isolate ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from env. Full test suite: 721 passed, 5 skipped, 0 failed. |
| 4.8.3 | 2026-04-02 | Fix chat live-card ordering bug: task_done event no longer races ahead of the assistant reply. Moved audit trail write from agent-side `append_jsonl` (which triggered immediate WebSocket push via `_log_sink`) to supervisor `_handle_task_done`, restoring causal ordering so `send_message` always reaches the UI before `task_done`. |
| 4.8.2 | 2026-04-02 | Fix SDK edit-mode hang: restore `receive_response()` (auto-stops after ResultMessage) instead of `receive_messages()` (streams indefinitely). Verified against live SDK v0.1.54 API. Confirmed embedded Python 3.10.19 in app bundle supports SDK natively. |
| 4.8.1 | 2026-04-02 | Fix Claude Agent SDK gateway: correct `receive_response()` → `receive_messages()` (method name mismatch), pass `max_budget_usd` in constructor, simplify read-only path to use `query()` instead of `ClaudeSDKClient` with unnecessary hooks. |
| 4.8.0 | 2026-04-02 | Claude Agent SDK integration: new `ouroboros/gateways/claude_code.py` gateway wrapping the `claude-agent-sdk` package with two execution paths — edit mode (PreToolUse hooks block writes outside cwd and to safety-critical files, `disallowed_tools=["Bash","MultiEdit"]`) and read-only mode (only Read/Grep/Glob allowed). Both `claude_code_edit` and `advisory_pre_review` use the SDK as primary path with automatic CLI subprocess fallback. Structured `ClaudeCodeResult` replaces raw stdout parsing. Project context (BIBLE, DEVELOPMENT, CHECKLISTS, ARCHITECTURE) injected via `system_prompt`. New `validate` parameter on `claude_code_edit` runs post-edit tests. 16 new gateway tests. |
| 4.7.2 | 2026-04-02 | Remove legacy `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_CHAT_IDS` setting from Settings UI, backend, and docs. Only the primary `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` mechanism remains. |
| 4.7.1 | 2026-04-01 | Public `v4.7` release line, consolidating everything added after `v4.5.0` into one external release: multi-provider LLM routing across OpenRouter, direct OpenAI, OpenAI-compatible endpoints, and Cloud.ru; optional async provider model catalog lookup; a shared multi-step onboarding wizard with provider detection, local-model presets, review mode/budget setup, and smarter first-run defaults; a redesigned desktop-first Settings UI with tabbed sections, searchable model pickers, masked secret inputs, explicit `Clear` actions, and local-model controls; an optional non-localhost password gate; the full Files tab/backend with browse, preview, download, upload, create, rename, move, copy, delete, explicit network-safe roots, and intentional symlink-aware behavior; a bidirectional Telegram bridge with mirrored text, typing/actions, photos, and durable chat binding; live task cards in Chat plus grouped task timelines in Logs instead of step spam; the advisory pre-review layer, durable review-state tracking, scope review, shared review helpers, and a tool-capabilities single source of truth; `runtime_env` injection into LLM context; a longer default tool timeout for slow installs and shell work; and the UX/reliability polish shipped across the internal `4.7.x` line, including markdown-capable live cards, muted progress bubbles, reconnect banners, status-badge fixes, better reply/restart ordering, safer local-dev startup behavior, and sturdier supervisor recovery. |
| 4.7.0 | 2026-03-22 | Provider-and-UI overhaul release: add multi-provider model routing (OpenRouter, OpenAI, OpenAI-compatible, Cloud.ru), official-OpenAI auto-default migration plus OpenAI-only review fallback, multi-step onboarding with first-step multi-key entry and visible model review, desktop-first Settings redesign with searchable model pickers and explicit secret clearing, Telegram bridge with bidirectional text/actions/photos/chat binding, one expandable live task card in Chat, grouped task cards in Logs, and intentional external-symlink full CRUD semantics in the Files tab while preserving explicit network root and root-delete protection. |
| 4.6.0 | 2026-03-22 | Files and network runtime release: add the Web UI Files tab with extracted backend routes, bounded preview/upload behavior, root-delete protection, encoded image preview URLs, and safer path containment; add minimal password gate for non-localhost browser/API access; add source/docker host+port entrypoint support with repo-shaped Docker runtime and explicit file-root configuration for network mode. |
| 4.5.0 | 2026-03-19 | Context quality and prompt discipline release: fix provenance — system summaries now correctly marked as system, not user, across memory, consolidation, server API, and chat UI (amber system bubbles); restore execution reflections (task_reflections.jsonl) in live LLM context; move Health Invariants to the top of dynamic context block (both task and consciousness paths); task-scope recent progress/tools/events when task_id is available; harden run_shell against literal $VAR env-ref misuse in argv; add Claude CLI first-run retry and structured error classification; full SYSTEM.md editorial rewrite — terminology normalized to 'creator', new Methodology Check / Anti-Reactivity / Diagnostics Discipline / Knowledge Retrieval Triggers sections, stronger Health Invariant reactions, compressed inventory sections. 12 files changed, new regression tests. |
| 4.4.0 | 2026-03-19 | Safe editing release: `str_replace_editor` tool for surgical edits to existing files, `repo_write` shrink guard blocks accidental truncation of tracked files (>30% shrinkage), full task lifecycle statuses (failed/interrupted/cancelled) with honest status tracking, rescue snapshot discoverability via health invariants, `provider_incomplete_response` classification for OpenRouter glitches, default review enforcement changed to advisory, fix progress bubble opacity and duplicate emoji. |
| 4.3.1 | 2026-03-19 | Fix: remove semi-transparent dimming from progress chat bubbles and remove duplicate `💬` emoji that appeared in both sender label and message text. |
| 4.3.0 | 2026-03-19 | Reliability and continuity release: remove silent truncation from critical task/memory paths, persist honest subtask lifecycle states and full task results, restore transient chat wake banner, replace local-model hard prompt slicing with explicit non-core compaction plus fail-fast overflow, route Anthropic/OpenRouter calls without hard provider pinning while keeping parameter guarantees, and align async review calls with shared LLM routing/usage observability. |
| 4.2.0 | 2026-03-16 | Cross-platform hardening release: replace Unix-only file locking in memory/consolidation with Windows-safe locking, refresh default model tiers (Opus main/code, Sonnet light/fallback, task effort `medium`), improve reconnect recovery with heartbeat/watchdog/history resync, switch local model chat format to auto-detect, and sync public docs with the current codebase and BIBLE structure. |
| 4.0.9 | 2026-03-15 | Packaging completeness release: bundle `assets/`, restore custom app icon from `assets/icon.icns`, and copy assets into the bootstrapped repo on fresh install so the shipped app and repo are no longer missing the visual asset layer. |
| 4.0.8 | 2026-03-15 | Fix web restart/reconnect path: robust WebSocket retry with `onerror` handling, queued outgoing chat messages during reconnect, visible reconnect overlay, and no-cache `index.html` to reduce stale frontend recovery bugs. |
| 4.0.7 | 2026-03-15 | Constitution sync release: update `BIBLE.md` to match the shipped `Advisory` / `Blocking` commit-review model, so bundled app behavior and constitutional text no longer disagree. |
| 4.0.6 | 2026-03-15 | Live logs overhaul: timeline-style `Logs` tab with task/context/LLM/tool/heartbeat phases and expandable raw events. Commit review now supports `Advisory` vs `Blocking` enforcement in Settings while still always running review. Context now keeps the last 1000 explicit chat messages in the recent-chat section. |
| 4.0.0 | 2026-03-15 | **Major release.** Modular core architecture (agent_startup_checks, agent_task_pipeline, loop_llm_call, loop_tool_execution, context_compaction, tool_policy). No-silent-truncation context contract: cognitive artifacts preserved whole, file-size budget health invariants. New episodic memory pipeline (task_summary -> chat.jsonl -> block consolidation). Stronger background consciousness (StatefulToolExecutor, per-tool timeouts, 10-round default). Per-context Playwright browser lifecycle. Generic public identity: all legacy persona traces removed from prompts, docs, UI, and constitution. BIBLE.md v4: process memory, no-silent-truncation, DRY/prompts-are-code, review-gated commits, provenance awareness. Safe git bootstrap (no destructive rm -rf). Fixed subtask depth accounting, consciousness state persistence, startup memory ordering, frozen registry memory_tools. 8 new regression test files. |

Older releases are preserved in Git tags and GitHub releases. Internal patch-level iterations that led to
the public `v4.7.1` release are intentionally collapsed into the single public entry above.
