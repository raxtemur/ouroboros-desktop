# Ouroboros v4.30.4 — Architecture & Reference

This document describes every component, page, button, API endpoint, and data flow.
It is the single source of truth for how the system works. Keep it updated.

### Two-process model

1. **launcher.py** — immutable outer shell (lives inside the `.app` bundle, not in the git repo). Never self-modifies. Handles:
   - PID lock (single instance)
   - Bootstrap: copies workspace to `~/Ouroboros/repo/` on first run
   - Core file sync: overwrites safety-critical files on every launch
   - Starts `server.py` as a subprocess via embedded Python
   - Shows PyWebView window pointed at `http://127.0.0.1:8765`
   - Monitors subprocess; restarts on exit code 42 (restart signal)
  - First-run wizard (shared desktop/web onboarding for multi-key and optional local setup)
   - **Graceful shutdown with orphan cleanup** (see Shutdown section below)

2. **server.py** — self-editable inner server. Can be modified by the agent.
   - Starlette app with HTTP API + WebSocket
   - Runs supervisor in a background thread
   - Supervisor manages worker pool, task queue, message routing
   - Local model lifecycle endpoints extracted to `ouroboros/local_model_api.py`

## 2. Startup / Onboarding Flow

```
launcher.py main()
  │
  ├── acquire_pid_lock()        → Show "already running" if locked
  ├── check_git()               → Show "install git" wizard if missing
  ├── bootstrap_repo()          → Copy workspace to ~/Ouroboros/repo/ (first run)
  │                               OR sync core files (subsequent runs)
  ├── _run_first_run_wizard()   → Show shared setup wizard if no runnable config
  │                               (access entry → models → review mode → budget → summary)
  │                               Saves to ~/Ouroboros/data/settings.json
  ├── agent_lifecycle_loop()    → Background thread: start/monitor server.py
  └── webview.start()           → Open PyWebView window at http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

### First-run wizard

Shown when `settings.json` does not contain any supported remote provider key and has no
`LOCAL_MODEL_SOURCE`.

- Existing OpenRouter, OpenAI, OpenAI-compatible, Cloud.ru, Anthropic, or local-model-source settings skip the wizard automatically.
- The wizard is shared between desktop and web: one HTML/CSS/JS onboarding flow is rendered directly in pywebview for desktop and injected into a blocking web overlay for Docker/browser runs.
- The wizard is multi-step and provider-aware: it starts with a single access step that accepts multiple remote keys plus optional local-model setup, then shows visible model defaults, a dedicated review-mode step, a dedicated budget step, and the final summary before save.
- When an Anthropic key is present, onboarding shows the Claude runtime status with `Repair Runtime` and `Skip for now` options.
- Desktop first-run uses the same onboarding bundle and talks to Claude SDK install/status through `pywebview` bridge methods.
  Web onboarding uses `/api/claude-code/status` and `/api/claude-code/install`.
- The wizard blocks progression if nothing runnable is configured.
- When OpenRouter is absent and official OpenAI is the only configured remote runtime, untouched default model values are auto-remapped to `openai::gpt-5.4` / `openai::gpt-5.4-mini` so first-run startup does not strand the app on OpenRouter-only defaults.
- `web_search` uses the official OpenAI Responses API only. It requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` and treats any non-empty `OPENAI_BASE_URL` as an incompatible custom runtime configuration rather than a fallback.
- OpenAI-compatible and Cloud.ru remain explicit model-selection flows from the full Settings page because there is no single safe universal default model ID for those providers.
- Closing the wizard without saving is non-fatal: the main app still launches and the user can finish configuration in Settings.

### Core file sync (`_sync_core_files`)

On every launch (not just first run), these files are copied from the workspace
bundle to `~/Ouroboros/repo/`, ensuring safety-critical code cannot be permanently
corrupted by agent self-modification:

- `prompts/SAFETY.md`
- `ouroboros/safety.py`
- `ouroboros/tools/registry.py`

---

## 3. Web UI Pages & Buttons

The web UI is a single-page app (`web/index.html` + `web/style.css` + ES modules).
`web/app.js` is the thin orchestrator (~90 lines) that imports from `web/modules/`:
- `ws.js` — WebSocket connection manager
- `utils.js` — shared utilities (markdown rendering, escapeHtml, matrix rain)
- `chat.js` — chat page with message rendering, live task card, compact runtime controls, and budget pill
- `logs.js` — log viewer with category filters and grouped task cards
- `log_events.js` — shared event summarization/grouping helpers used by Chat and Logs
- `files.js` — file browser, preview, uploads, and editor
- `evolution.js` — evolution chart (Chart.js) + versions sub-tab (git commits, tags, rollback, promote)
- `settings.js` — settings form with local model management
- `settings_controls.js` — searchable model pickers + segmented effort controls
- `costs.js` — cost breakdown tables
- `about.js` — about page

Navigation is a left sidebar with 7 pages (Chat, Files, Logs, Costs, Evolution, Settings, About).

### 3.1 Chat

- **Status badge** (top-right): "Online" (green) / "Thinking..." / "Working..." (amber pulse) / "Reconnecting..." (red).
  Driven by WebSocket connection state, typing events, and live task state.
- **Header controls**: compact buttons for `/evolve`, `/bg`, `/review`, `/restart`, `/panic` — the canonical location for runtime controls. The chat header is a floating transparent overlay (`position: absolute`, gradient fade) so messages scroll beneath it.
- **Budget pill**: compact amber pill in the header showing `$spent / $limit` with a mini progress bar, updated from `/api/state` polling every 3 seconds.
- **Message input**: absolute-positioned frosted-glass overlay anchored to the bottom of the chat page (`position: absolute; bottom: 0`). Contains a paperclip attachment button (positioned as an absolute overlay inside the textarea on the left; opens a file picker; selected file is staged locally in JS memory and shown as a removable filename preview badge — the file is uploaded to `data/uploads/` only when Send/Enter is triggered; if the WebSocket is offline at send time, upload is blocked with an error (no upload happens when disconnected, preventing orphan files). If the WebSocket drops after upload completes but before message delivery, the queued message references a durable server-side file that persists until explicitly deleted), a textarea (grows up to 120px; `padding-left: 42px` and `padding-right: 76px` leave space for both overlay controls), and a **send group** (`.chat-send-group`) positioned as an absolute overlay inside the textarea on the right, anchored to the bottom (`bottom: 8px`). The send group contains a Send/Plan button (`.chat-send-inline`) and a chevron button (`.chat-send-chevron`) with a subtle divider. The send group has a **two-click send model**: the chevron opens a glassmorphism dropdown (`.chat-send-dropdown`) with **Send** and **Plan** items that *switch the active send mode* — they do NOT immediately send. The main button label, colour, and chevron tint reflect the active mode: crimson for Send (default), amber (`var(--amber)`) for Plan. Once the mode is set, clicking the main button or pressing Enter sends in that mode. Mode state is stored as `data-send-mode` on `.chat-send-group` (DOM-backed, CSS-readable single source of truth); `setSendMode(mode)` synchronises button text, title, and `data-mode-active` markers on dropdown items. The chevron is always visible (tappable on touchscreens). The dropdown closes on outside click, item selection, or Escape key. `sendMessage(planMode)` is the shared send function; both the sendBtn click listener and the Enter keydown handler derive `planMode` from `sendGroup.dataset.sendMode === 'plan'` using explicit arrow functions to avoid `MouseEvent` truthy-arg bug. Slash commands bypass the plan prefix regardless of mode. The `#chat-input` textarea has `backdrop-filter: blur(16px)` + semi-transparent background (frosted glass). The `#chat-input-area` wrapper uses only a gradient fade overlay (no backdrop-filter) so message bubbles scroll underneath without a sharp-edged blur rectangle. `#chat-messages` `padding-bottom` is set dynamically via `updateMessagesPadding()` in chat.js (real overlay height + 16px buffer), called on page connect, textarea resize, and attachment preview toggle. The CSS default is `84px` (covers min-height state); JS adjusts up to ~160px when the textarea is fully expanded. Shift+Enter for newline, Enter to send.
- **Input recall**: ArrowUp / ArrowDown cycles through recent submitted messages without leaving the textarea.
- **Messages**: user bubbles (right, steel-blue-tinted), assistant bubbles (left, crimson), and system-summary bubbles (left, amber). Non-user bubbles render markdown. Live task card uses crimson accent glass matching the assistant palette.
- **Multi-user visibility**: user messages are now session-aware. The current browser session stays labeled as `You`; other Web UI sessions render as `WebUI (<session>)`; Telegram-origin messages render with their Telegram sender label.
- **Timestamps**: smart relative formatting (today: "HH:MM", yesterday: "Yesterday, HH:MM", older: "Mon DD, HH:MM"). Shown on hover.
- **Live task card**: reasoning/progress/tool chatter no longer spams the transcript as many assistant bubbles.
  Chat listens to `log_event`/task events plus progress messages and collapses them into one expandable task card with a timeline of steps.
- **Recoverable step failures**: step-level shell/tool failures stay as timeline notes and no longer freeze the card in a terminal `Issue` state.
  Later progress updates can retake the headline until the task actually finishes.
- **System summaries**: `direction="system"` entries from `chat.jsonl` are shown in the same timeline with a 📋 label instead of being hidden or treated as user text.
- **Typing indicator**: animated "thinking dots" bubble appears when the agent is processing.
- **Persistence**: chat history loaded from server on page load (`/api/chat/history`), survives app restarts. Fallback to sessionStorage. `syncHistory` uses two-pass processing: progress/summary messages are replayed first (building live card timelines), then regular assistant/user messages are processed (calling `finishLiveCard`). This guarantees thinking bubbles are never discarded due to `taskState.completed` being set before progress events are applied. After first load, if any live card is still active (task ongoing mid-reload), `showTyping()` is called to restore the typing indicator.
- **Duplicate-bubble prevention**: queued local user bubbles carry a `client_message_id`; echoed WebSocket/history messages with the same id are merged instead of duplicated.
- **Empty-chat init**: if neither server history nor sessionStorage has messages, the UI shows a transient assistant bubble: `Ouroboros has awakened`. This is visual-only and is not written to chat history.
- **Telegram bridge**: Web UI initiated chats can be mirrored into the bound Telegram chat, Telegram text input is injected back into the same live chat timeline, and Telegram photos are bridged as image-aware user messages (including while a direct-chat turn is already running).
- **Live card cleanup and reconnect recovery**: after a 2-minute `scheduleTaskUiCleanup` timer, finished task cards are **left fully intact** — the DOM node, backing `rec.items` array, and `liveCardRecords` entry are all preserved so the card remains visible with working expand/collapse interactions and so a later reconnect `syncHistory` can rebind the existing node without creating a duplicate. Only the task ID is added to `retiredTaskIds` so routine incremental `scheduleHistorySync()` calls (fired 700ms after each new task) do NOT re-build the card from history mid-session. On soft restart (same-SHA WS reconnect), `syncHistory` receives `fromReconnect=true` so `retiredTaskIds` is cleared and server history is authoritative — cards are reconstructed from `progress.jsonl` entries. The final `liveCardRecords` sweep in `syncHistory` skips cards where `ts.cardVisible === false && ts.completed === true` (trivial 0-tool-call tasks) to avoid a cluster of invisible placeholder nodes appearing at the end of the chat.
- Messages sent via WebSocket `{type: "chat", content: text, sender_session_id: "uuid"}`.
- Responses arrive via WebSocket `{type: "chat", role, content, ts, source?, sender_label?, sender_session_id?, client_message_id?}` and `{type: "photo", role, image_base64, mime, caption?, ts, source?, sender_label?}`. On page-load history sync, `/api/chat/history` can also return `role: "system"` entries for internal summaries plus metadata for multi-user reconstruction.
- Supports slash commands: `/status`, `/evolve`, `/review`, `/bg`, `/restart`, `/panic`.

### 3.2 Files

- **Browser pane**: directory tree for the configured root, breadcrumb navigation, inline filter, refresh button,
  create-file/create-directory actions, clipboard-style copy/move/paste, and delete/download context menu.
- **Preview pane**: text preview/editor, image preview, binary-file placeholder, and drag-drop upload target.
- **Write safety**: unsaved text edits are guarded on folder switches, file switches, page navigation, and browser refresh.
- **Root policy**: localhost requests fall back to the current user's home directory when no root is configured.
  Network/Docker access requires an explicit `OUROBOROS_FILE_BROWSER_DEFAULT` directory.
- **Network policy**: `OUROBOROS_NETWORK_PASSWORD` is optional. When configured, non-loopback browser/API access is gated.
  When omitted, the full HTTP/WebSocket surface remains reachable by design. `/api/health` always stays public.
- **Symlink policy**: entries are constrained lexically to the configured root, but symlink targets may resolve outside that root intentionally.
  External symlink paths support list/read/download/content/write/mkdir/upload/copy/move/delete. Root-delete protection still applies only to the configured root itself.
- **Transfer semantics**: copy/move of symlink entries preserves the link object; writing through a symlink-backed file edits the target content.
- **Bounds**: directory listings are capped, previews are bounded to a text/byte limit, and uploads reject oversized payloads.

### 3.3 Dashboard (removed in v4.10.0)

The Dashboard tab has been removed. Its functionality is now distributed:
- **Budget**: shown as a compact pill in the Chat header (polls `/api/state` every 3s).
- **Evolve/BG toggles**: Chat header buttons (glow when active).
- **Review/Restart/Panic**: Chat header buttons.
- **Runtime status (evolution/consciousness detail)**: Evolution page runtime card.

### 3.4 Settings

- **Tabbed layout**: `Providers`, `Models`, `Behavior`, `Integrations`, `Advanced`.
- **Provider cards**: OpenRouter, OpenAI, OpenAI-compatible, Cloud.ru, Anthropic, plus optional Network Password. Cards are collapsible and use masked-secret inputs with show/hide toggles.
- **API Keys**: OpenRouter, OpenAI, OpenAI-compatible, Cloud.ru, Anthropic, Telegram Bot Token, GitHub Token, and Network Password.
  Keys are displayed as masked values (e.g., `sk-or-v1...`), can be explicitly cleared, and are only overwritten on save if the user enters a new value (not containing `...`).
- **Claude Runtime Status**: when Anthropic is configured, the Anthropic card shows app-managed Claude runtime status with `Repair Runtime` action.
  The Claude runtime (SDK + bundled CLI) powers delegated code editing and advisory review and is managed automatically by the app.
- **Providers tab**: also contains `Legacy OpenAI Base URL` (backward-compatibility escape hatch for older installs) and `Network Gate` (LAN Access toggle with dynamic LAN IP hint + optional non-localhost password) at the bottom. When the LAN Access toggle is enabled, a hint below the checkbox fetches `/api/network-info` and displays clickable `http://<LAN-IP>:<port>` links so the user knows exactly which address to open on other devices.
- **Models tab**: Main, Code, Light, Fallback model routing. Each card has a `Local` toggle to route through the GGUF server configured in Advanced. `Claude Code Model` field selects the Anthropic model for `claude_code_edit` / `advisory_pre_review`.
- **Model catalog**: optional `Refresh Model Catalog` action calls `/api/model-catalog`. Failures are non-fatal and surfaced as inline warnings.
- **Model pickers**: searchable provider-aware pickers replace legacy raw dropdowns for remote models.
- **Provider prefixes**:
  - OpenRouter model values stay unprefixed (`anthropic/claude-opus-4.6`).
  - OpenAI model values use `openai::...`.
  - OpenAI-compatible model values use `openai-compatible::...`.
  - Cloud.ru model values use `cloudru::...`.
  - Anthropic model values use `anthropic::...` (e.g. `anthropic::claude-opus-4.6`).
- **Behavior tab**: agent-behavior policy settings — Reasoning Effort and Review Enforcement (the two-button advisory/blocking toggle). Review models and Web Search Model live in the Models tab alongside model routing.
- **Reasoning Effort**: Five segmented controls for task/chat, evolution, review, scope review, and consciousness.
  Backed by `OUROBOROS_EFFORT_TASK`, `OUROBOROS_EFFORT_EVOLUTION`, `OUROBOROS_EFFORT_REVIEW`,
  `OUROBOROS_EFFORT_SCOPE_REVIEW`, `OUROBOROS_EFFORT_CONSCIOUSNESS`. Loading falls back to legacy
  `OUROBOROS_INITIAL_REASONING_EFFORT` for task/chat when the new key is absent.
- **Review Models**: Comma-separated remote model IDs for pre-commit review.
  Backed by `OUROBOROS_REVIEW_MODELS`.
- **Scope Review Model**: Single model for the blocking scope reviewer.
  Backed by `OUROBOROS_SCOPE_REVIEW_MODEL` (default `anthropic/claude-opus-4.6`).
- **OpenAI-only review fallback**: if official OpenAI is the only configured remote runtime and the review list is invalid/underspecified, review falls back to the main model repeated three times.
- **Review Enforcement**: `Advisory` or `Blocking` for pre-commit review behavior. Rendered as a two-button segmented toggle (advisory = amber, blocking = crimson) rather than a dropdown.
  Backed by `OUROBOROS_REVIEW_ENFORCEMENT`. Review always runs in both modes.
- **Advanced tab**: local model runtime, max workers, tool timeout, soft/hard timeout, and reset controls. Total budget and per-task cost cap have moved to the **Costs** page.
- **Local Model Runtime**: source, GGUF filename, port, GPU layers, context length, chat format, start/stop/test buttons, live local-model status, real download progress bar (updates via `download_progress` from `/api/local-model/status`), and an **Install Local Runtime** button (hidden until runtime is missing). The Start button performs a preflight check via `/api/local-model/start` before downloading; on a `runtime_missing` (HTTP 412) response it surfaces the install button and a human-readable hint instead of a raw traceback. After install completes (`runtime_status == "install_ok"`), the start flow resumes automatically if a source was configured. `LOCAL_MODEL_FILENAME` now accepts subfolder paths (`quant/model.gguf`) and split GGUF patterns (`quant/model-00001-of-00003.gguf`); all shards are downloaded automatically and the server is started with the first shard. If the user omits the subfolder prefix (types just the bare filename), `_resolve_hf_path` auto-resolves the full path by querying `list_repo_files` on the HF repo (fail-open on network errors).
- **Telegram**: Bot Token and primary chat id. If no primary chat id is pinned, the bridge binds to the first active Telegram chat and keeps replies attached there.
- **GitHub**: Token + Repo (for remote sync).
- **Save Settings** button → POST `/api/settings`. Hot-reload contract:
  - **Budget (`TOTAL_BUDGET`), timeouts (`OUROBOROS_SOFT_TIMEOUT_SEC`, `OUROBOROS_HARD_TIMEOUT_SEC`, `OUROBOROS_TOOL_TIMEOUT_SEC`), and integrations (`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_REPO`)**: refresh immediately in the running supervisor (no restart, no task boundary). `/status` reads live timeout values.
  - **Models, API keys, effort, review settings, `OUROBOROS_PER_TASK_COST_USD`**: applied via `apply_settings_to_env(load_settings())` at the start of the **next task**. Current in-flight task is unaffected.
  - **Local model server, worker count, base URLs, and some provider runtime parameters**: require a full process restart to take effect.
  - Save response always includes `status: "saved"`. Optional keys present only when applicable: `no_changes` (bool), `restart_required` (bool) + `restart_keys` (list), `immediate_changed` (bool, true when any key from `_IMMEDIATE_KEYS` changed — budget, timeouts, Telegram, GitHub), `next_task_changed` (bool, true when any other hot-reloadable key changed — models, API keys, effort, review settings, per-task cost), `warnings` (list). UI shows a 5-state message: no changes → restart required → mixed immediate+next-task → immediate only → next-task only; warnings appended to all branches.
- **Reset All Data** button (Danger Zone) → POST `/api/reset`.
  Deletes: state/, memory/, logs/, archive/, uploads/, settings.json.
  Keeps: repo/ (agent code).
  Triggers server restart. On next launch, onboarding wizard appears.

### 3.5 Logs

- **Filter chips**: Tools, LLM, Errors, Tasks, System, Consciousness.
  Toggle on/off to filter log entries.
- **Clear** button: clears the in-memory log view (not files on disk).
- Log entries arrive via WebSocket `{type: "log", data: event}`.
- The page renders a live timeline: standalone system/error entries stay as rows, while task/LLM/tool/progress events with a shared `task_id` collapse into grouped task cards with an expandable internal timeline.
- Chat and Logs share the same event summarization logic from `log_events.js`, so a task phase is described the same way in both places.
- Each standalone row or grouped task card has a **Raw** toggle that expands the latest original JSON payload.
- New live-only timeline events cover task start, context building, LLM round start/finish,
  tool start/finish/timeout, and compact task heartbeats during long waits.
- Repeated startup/system events such as verification bursts are compacted in the UI.
- Max 500 entries in view (oldest removed).

### 3.6 Versions (merged into Evolution in v4.10.0)

The standalone Versions tab has been merged into the Evolution page as a sub-tab.
See section 3.8 (Evolution) for the combined page.

### 3.7 Costs

- **Budget card** at top of page: Total Budget (`s-budget`) and Per-task Cost Cap (`s-per-task-cost`) inputs with a **Save Budget** button that POSTs directly to `/api/settings`. These fields moved here from Settings → Advanced so the full financial picture lives in one place.
- **Total Spent / Total Calls / Top Model** stat cards below the budget card.
- **Breakdown tables**: By Model, By API Key, By Model Category, By Task Category.
  Each row shows name, call count, cost, and a proportional bar.
- **Refresh** button reloads data from `/api/cost-breakdown`.
- Data auto-loads when the page becomes active (MutationObserver on class).

### 3.8 Evolution

Two sub-tabs ("Chart" and "Versions"), switchable via pill buttons in the page header.

**Chart sub-tab (default):**
- **Runtime status card**: evolution mode / consciousness pills, cycle count, queue, budget remaining, last evolution timestamp, next wakeup.
- **Chart**: interactive Chart.js line graph showing code LOC, prompt sizes (BIBLE, SYSTEM),
  identity, scratchpad, and total memory growth across all git tags.
- **Dual Y-axes**: left axis for Lines of Code, right axis for Size (KB).
- **Tags table**: detailed breakdown per tag with all metrics.
- Data fetched from `/api/evolution-data` (cached 60s server-side).
- Chart.js bundled locally (`web/chart.umd.min.js`) — no CDN dependency.

**Versions sub-tab:**
- **Current branch + SHA** displayed at top.
- **Recent Commits** list with SHA, date, message, and "Restore" button.
- **Tags** list with tag name, date, message, and "Restore" button.
- **Restore** button → POST `/api/git/rollback` with target SHA/tag.
  Creates rescue snapshot, resets to target, restarts server.
- **Promote to Stable** button → POST `/api/git/promote`.
  Updates `ouroboros-stable` branch to match `ouroboros`.
- Data loaded on first visit to the Versions sub-tab.
- **Refresh** button reloads data for the active sub-tab.

- `{type: "command", cmd: "/status"}` — send slash command

**Server → Client:**
- `{type: "chat", role, content, ts, source?, sender_label?, sender_session_id?, client_message_id?, telegram_chat_id?}` — user/assistant/system chat payloads

## 5. Supervisor Loop

Runs in a background thread inside `server.py:_run_supervisor()`.

Each iteration (0.5s sleep):
1. `rotate_chat_log_if_needed()` — archive chat.jsonl if > 800KB
2. `ensure_workers_healthy()` — respawn dead workers, detect crash storms
3. Drain event queue (worker→supervisor events via multiprocessing.Queue)
4. `enforce_task_timeouts()` — soft/hard timeout handling
5. `enqueue_evolution_task_if_needed()` — auto-queue evolution if enabled
6. `assign_tasks()` — match pending tasks to free workers
7. `persist_queue_snapshot()` — save queue state for crash recovery
8. Poll `LocalChatBridge` inbox for user messages
9. Route messages: slash commands → supervisor handlers; text → agent

### Worker crash handling and retry limits

When a worker process dies unexpectedly (e.g. SIGSEGV, signal -11) while
running a task, `ensure_workers_healthy()` in `supervisor/workers.py` performs
a three-way decision before requeueing:

1. **Already-completed check**: calls `load_task_result()` — if the task already
   reached a terminal state (e.g. completed via direct-chat inline path), the
   crash is silently skipped and the task is NOT requeued. Prevents duplicate execution.

2. **Retry limit exhausted** (`task["_attempt"] > QUEUE_MAX_RETRIES`): marks
   the task as `STATUS_FAILED`, emits a `task_done` event to close the chat UI
   live card, and sends an assistant message via `get_bridge()`. No requeue.

3. **Normal retry**: increments `task["_attempt"]` on a dict copy BEFORE requeue.
   The task is written with `STATUS_INTERRUPTED` and pushed to the front of the queue.

**Crash storm detection**: `respawn_worker()` no longer resets `_LAST_SPAWN_TIME`
(only `spawn_workers()` sets it at initial startup). This allows `CRASH_TS` to
accumulate 3 timestamps within 60 seconds during rapid crash loops, triggering
storm detection which kills all workers and switches to direct-chat mode.

**`deep_self_review` tasks** are exempt from the normal retry path — they fail
immediately on a crash signal (SIGSEGV) with a diagnostic message suggesting
`/restart` followed by `/review`.

### Slash command handling (server.py main loop)

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/panic` | Kill workers (force), request restart exit |
| `/restart` | Save state, safe_restart (git), kill workers, exit 42 |
| `/review` | Queue a deep self-review (1M-context single-pass Constitution review) |
| `/evolve on\|off` | Toggle evolution mode in state, prune evolution tasks if off |
| `/bg start\|stop\|status` | Control background consciousness |
| `/status` | Send status text with budget breakdown |
| (anything else) | Route to agent via `handle_chat_direct()` |

---

## 6. Agent Core

### Task lifecycle

1. Message arrives → `handle_chat_direct(chat_id, text, image_data)`
2. Creates task dict `{id, type, chat_id, text}`
3. `OuroborosAgent.handle_task(task)` →
   a. Build context (`context.py`): system prompt + bible + architecture + development guide + README + checklists, plus a **3-block system-memory layout**: (1) static governance/docs block (`cache_control: ttl=1h`), (2) semi-stable memory block for low-churn artifacts such as identity, knowledge base, patterns, and deep review (`cache_control: ephemeral`), and (3) dynamic working-memory/runtime block for scratchpad, dialogue history/summary, registry digest, drive/runtime state, review continuity, and recent sections
   b. `run_llm_loop()`: LLM call → tool execution → repeat until final text response
   c. Emit final `send_message`, `task_metrics`, and `task_done`; any restart request is latched until after those final events are queued
   d. Store task result synchronously; task summary and reflection run off the user-reply critical path. For non-trivial tasks, the task-summary prompt now explicitly requests a short operational meta-reflection about friction, weak assumptions, and what Ouroboros should change in its own process/prompts; if the summary LLM path fails, `_run_task_summary` still falls back to a one-line summary. The trivial fast-path remains exactly `0 tool calls AND ≤1 round`, and only that path bypasses the LLM summary path entirely and keeps the old 1–2 sentence summary with no meta-reflection.
4. Events flow back to supervisor via event queue

### Tool capability sets (tool_capabilities.py)

Single source of truth for all tool classification sets:
- **`CORE_TOOL_NAMES`** — tools available from round 1 (no `enable_tools` needed)
- **`META_TOOL_NAMES`** — discovery tools (`list_available_tools`, `enable_tools`)
- **`READ_ONLY_PARALLEL_TOOLS`** — safe for concurrent execution in ThreadPoolExecutor
- **`STATEFUL_BROWSER_TOOLS`** — require thread-sticky executor (Playwright affinity)
- **`REVIEWED_MUTATIVE_TOOLS`** — tools (`repo_commit`, `repo_write_commit`) that must NOT
  end with ambiguous timeouts; executor waits synchronously for the final result
- **`UNTRUNCATED_TOOL_RESULTS`** — tools whose output must never be truncated
- **`UNTRUNCATED_REPO_READ_PATHS`** — repo files that must stay whole when read
- **`TOOL_RESULT_LIMITS`** — per-tool output size caps (chars)

`tool_policy.py` and `loop_tool_execution.py` import from this module. The legacy
copy in `tools/registry.py` (safety-critical, overwritten on restart) is kept for
backward compatibility but is not the runtime authority.

### Tool execution (loop.py)

- Pricing/cost estimation logic extracted to `pricing.py` (model pricing table, cost estimation, API key inference, usage event emission)
- `build_llm_messages()` keeps the **3-block system prompt layout** stable for caching: (1) static governance/docs, (2) semi-stable identity + knowledge + patterns + deep review, (3) dynamic scratchpad/dialogue/registry/runtime sections.
- `call_llm_with_retry()` now records `cache_hit_rate` in each `llm_round` event (`cached_tokens / prompt_tokens`, clamped to 0 when prompt tokens are zero) so cache behaviour is observable in logs and health checks.
- `_sanitize_chat_completion_tools()` sorts tool schemas by function name before dispatch, stabilising cache keys across rounds while preserving deduplication of duplicate tool names.
- Direct `anthropic::...` routing preserves multipart system text blocks (including `cache_control`) instead of flattening them into one string, so the same cache boundaries survive both OpenRouter-Anthropic and direct Anthropic paths.
- **Per-task soft threshold**: Each task has a soft threshold (default $20, env `OUROBOROS_PER_TASK_COST_USD`). When a task exceeds this, the LLM is asked to wrap up soon. This is a reminder, not a hard stop.
- **Budget tracking coverage**: All LLM spend reaches the budget via two patterns: (1) **Tool path** — tools emit `llm_usage` events to `ctx.pending_events` (falling back from `ctx.event_queue`); (2) **Daemon thread path** — background threads (consolidation, reflection, supervisor dedup) call `supervisor.state.update_budget_from_usage` directly. Covered paths: main agent loop, safety LLM, web search, triad review, scope review (with pending_events fallback added v4.27.0), plan_task per-reviewer (added v4.27.0), advisory_pre_review SDK + fallback LLM costs (added v4.27.0), claude_code_edit (conditional on cost_usd > 0), consciousness loop, consolidation daemon threads (added v4.27.0), reflection LLM calls (added v4.27.0), supervisor _find_duplicate_task (added v4.27.0).
- **`memory_tools.py`**: Provides `memory_map` (read the metacognitive registry of all data sources) and `memory_update_registry` (add/update entries). Part of the Memory Registry system (v3.16.0).
- **`tool_discovery.py`**: Provides `list_available_tools` (discover non-core tools) and `enable_tools` (activate extra tools for the current task). Enables dynamic tool set management.
- **`code_search`**: First-class code search tool in `tools/core.py`. Literal search by default, regex optional. Skips binaries, caches, vendor dirs. Bounded output (max 200 results, 80K chars). Available from round 1 as a core tool. Replaces the pattern of using `run_shell` with `grep`/`rg` for code search.
- Core tools always available; extra tools discoverable via `list_available_tools`/`enable_tools`
- Read-only tools can run in parallel (ThreadPoolExecutor)
- Browser tools use thread-sticky executor (Playwright greenlet affinity)
- All tools have hard timeout (default 600s, per-tool overrides for browser/search/vision); `OUROBOROS_TOOL_TIMEOUT_SEC` in `settings.json` is the runtime SSOT override read on each tool call. The actual timeout is `max(settings_value, per_tool_declared)` so tools declaring a higher minimum (e.g. `claude_code_edit` at 1200s) are never silently capped by a lower global default.
- Multi-layer safety: hardcoded sandbox (registry.py) → deterministic whitelist → LLM safety supervisor
- Tool results use explicit per-tool caps with visible truncation markers (`repo_read`/`data_read`/`knowledge_read`/`run_shell`: 80k, default: 15k chars). Cognitive reads (`memory/*`, prompts, BIBLE/docs, commit/review outputs) are exempt from silent clipping.
- `run_shell` now treats non-zero exits as explicit failed tool outcomes and records exit/signal metadata in the tool trace.
- `run_shell` recovers `cmd` passed as a string via a three-step cascade: `json.loads` (JSON array strings) → `ast.literal_eval` (Python literal lists) → `shlex.split` (plain shell strings). Only truly unrecoverable input returns `SHELL_ARG_ERROR`. The `cmd` parameter schema remains `type: array` (intended contract), but the runtime gracefully handles LLM misformatting.
- `set_tool_timeout` persists `OUROBOROS_TOOL_TIMEOUT_SEC` to `settings.json` and hot-applies it without restart.
- `/api/claude-code/status` returns app-managed Claude runtime status (SDK version, CLI path/version, app-managed flag, legacy detection, API key readiness, last stderr on failure); `/api/claude-code/install` repairs/updates the app-managed runtime.
- Desktop onboarding shows Claude runtime status and repair action (the runtime is managed automatically by the app).
- **Local model tool-call parsing** (`LLMClient._parse_tool_calls_from_content`): when a local model returns text instead of structured `tool_calls`, this static method detects `<tool_call>{"name":...,"arguments":...}</tool_call>` XML blocks and converts them to the standard tool-call format. Safety guard: response must consist *solely* of one or more `<tool_call>` blocks — mixed prose is rejected. **Qwen3 think mode** (v4.28.0): `<think>...</think>` and `<reasoning>...</reasoning>` wrappers are stripped before the full-match safety guard; the extracted reasoning text is preserved in `msg["content"]` so `loop.py` can emit it as a progress note. Arbitrary prose without a think wrapper is still rejected, keeping the false-positive rate low. Double-brace `{{...}}` Qwen Jinja2 template artefacts are also handled.
- **`seal_task_transcript`**: called after compaction and before each `call_llm_with_retry`. Marks one stable tool-result boundary with `cache_control: ephemeral` to improve Anthropic prompt cache hits. Reverts all previous seals first so compaction always sees plain strings. Provider handling: OpenRouter (Anthropic models) passes list content blocks through as-is; direct Anthropic path preserves list content for `tool_result` (Anthropic API supports content blocks there); `_strip_cache_control` in `llm.py` now flattens tool-role list content back to a plain string for OpenAI, OpenAI-compatible, Cloud.ru, and local providers.
- **Reviewed mutative tool timeout handling** (v4.9.0): `repo_commit` and `repo_write_commit`
  are classified as `REVIEWED_MUTATIVE_TOOLS`. When they exceed the configured tool timeout,
  the executor emits a `tool_call_late` progress event but continues waiting synchronously
  for the real result (hard ceiling: 1800s). This prevents ambiguous "tool timed out, maybe
  still running" states for commit operations.
- Context compaction kicks in after round 8 (summarizes old tool results)
- **Loop checkpoint** (`_maybe_inject_self_check`): every 15 rounds, an audit-only self-check message is
  injected into the transcript. Includes: checkpoint number, round/max, token count, cost so far,
  and a **last-15-tool-call trace** built by `_build_recent_tool_trace` (P3 LLM-First — trace is
  provided as factual data, the LLM decides if it represents repetition). On checkpoint rounds,
  `run_llm_loop` passes `tools=None` to `call_llm_with_retry` in both primary and fallback paths,
  so the model cannot silently switch into tool use instead of reflection. The checkpoint prompt asks
  the LLM to write a `CHECKPOINT_REFLECTION:` block with four structured fields: **Known** (verified
  facts), **Blocker** (concrete obstacle or 'none'), **Decision** (approach and rationale), **Next**
  (most important next action). The wording explicitly frames the reflection as operational rather than
  narrative, asks the model to reconsider whether the current approach/plan is still valid, and calls
  out narrower scope or a different line of attack as valid checkpoint outcomes while preserving the
  exact `Known/Blocker/Decision/Next` parser contract.
  **Audit-only invariant**: a checkpoint round can never finalize the task. `ouroboros/loop.py::_handle_checkpoint_response`
  classifies the output as either a valid reflection or a checkpoint anomaly, persists the artifact,
  appends a synthetic continuation user message, and continues into the next normal round.
  Missing markers, empty output, or malformed audit text are never treated as final answers.
  **Compaction protection**: `context_compaction.py::_round_has_protected_content` detects assistant
  messages containing either `"CHECKPOINT_REFLECTION"` or `"CHECKPOINT_ANOMALY"` and marks the entire
  span as protected, so audit artifacts survive `compact_tool_history_llm` and remain visible to all
  subsequent rounds throughout the task. After the LLM responds on a checkpoint round, one of two
  durable paths fires: (1) `_emit_checkpoint_reflection_event` emits `task_checkpoint_reflection`
  with the full assistant content (no truncation, P1 Continuity); or (2) `_emit_checkpoint_anomaly_event`
  emits `task_checkpoint_anomaly` with the malformed/empty output and anomaly type. In both cases,
  a progress message is emitted via `emit_progress` so the artifact appears in the chat live card
  timeline and survives page reload/reconnect via `progress.jsonl` replay.
  `task_checkpoint`, `task_checkpoint_reflection`, and `task_checkpoint_anomaly` events are handled in
  `web/modules/log_events.js::summarizeLogEvent` (Logs tab timeline with metadata) and by
  `summarizeChatLiveEvent` (returns `visible: false` for checkpoint events — the chat live card uses
  the emit_progress path as the single visible source to avoid duplicates). All three event types are
  persisted to `logs/events.jsonl` by `supervisor/events.py::_handle_log_event`. When `event_queue`
  is `None` (direct/test path), reflection and anomaly events fall back to direct `append_jsonl`.

### Claude runtime (gateways/claude_code.py + platform_layer.py)

- **App-managed runtime**: the app bundle owns a pinned `claude-agent-sdk` + bundled
  Claude CLI baseline. The SDK's own bundled-CLI-first resolution is preserved — the
  gateway never overrides CLI path selection via PATH heuristics.
- **Auth model**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` only. No support for native Claude login.
- **Full stderr capture**: both edit and readonly paths pass a `stderr` callback into
  `ClaudeAgentOptions`. Raw CLI stderr is stored in a ring buffer and surfaced in
  `ClaudeCodeResult.stderr_tail` on failure, eliminating the old "Check stderr output
  for details" blind spot.
- **Runtime resolver** (`ouroboros.platform_layer.resolve_claude_runtime`): deterministic
  snapshot of SDK version, CLI path/version, app-managed vs legacy status, API key
  readiness. Used by the status API, install/repair endpoint, and gateway diagnostics.
- **Legacy detection**: SDK installed outside `python-standalone` (e.g. user-site in
  `~/.local/lib`) is classified as legacy and silently de-prioritized.
- **Two execution modes:**
  - **Edit mode** (`run_edit`): `allowed_tools=["Read","Edit","Grep","Glob"]`,
    `disallowed_tools=["Bash","MultiEdit"]`, `permission_mode="acceptEdits"`,
    PreToolUse hook blocks writes outside `cwd` and to safety-critical files
  - **Read-only mode** (`run_readonly`): uses the simpler `query()` function with
    `allowed_tools=["Read","Grep","Glob"]`,
    `disallowed_tools=["Bash","Edit","Write","MultiEdit"]` (SDK enforces tool
    restrictions at the CLI level; no hooks needed)
- **Structured result**: `ClaudeCodeResult` dataclass with `success`, `result_text`,
  `session_id`, `cost_usd`, `usage`, `error`, `stderr_tail`. Callers populate
  `changed_files`, `diff_stat`, and `validation_summary` (orchestration lives in tool layer)
- **Orchestration in callers**: project context injection (BIBLE.md, DEVELOPMENT.md,
  CHECKLISTS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md), git stat, and post-edit validation live in
  `ouroboros/tools/shell.py` helpers — the gateway stays a pure transport boundary
- **Defense-in-depth**: post-edit revert in `registry.py` remains as secondary safety layer
- Safety-critical files mirror: `BIBLE.md`, `ouroboros/safety.py`,
  `ouroboros/tools/registry.py`, `prompts/SAFETY.md`

### Git tools (tools/git.py + tools/review.py + supervisor/git_ops.py)

- **`repo_write`** (v3.24.0): write file(s) to disk WITHOUT committing. Supports single-file
  (`path` + `content`) and multi-file (`files` array) modes. Preferred workflow:
  `repo_write` all files → `advisory_pre_review` on the final diff → `repo_commit`.
- **`repo_commit`**: stage + advisory freshness gate + unified pre-commit review + commit + tests + auto-tag + auto-push.
  Includes `review_rebuttal` parameter for disputing reviewer feedback.
- **`repo_write_commit`**: legacy single-file write+commit (kept for compatibility).
  Also checks advisory freshness, then runs unified review before commit.
- **Unified pre-commit review** (v3.24.0): triad diff review (3 models against
  `docs/CHECKLISTS.md`) plus a blocking scope review that runs in parallel on the
  same staged snapshot. `Blocking` mode keeps critical findings as hard gates;
  `Advisory` mode surfaces the same findings as warnings and lets the commit
  continue. Review history carried across blocking iterations. Quorum: at least
  2 of 3 triad reviewers must succeed in blocking mode. Deterministic preflight
  (uses `git diff --cached --name-status`;
  renames expand to `D src + A dst`; copies expand to `A dst` only; deleted files excluded
  from companion-file presence checks) catches VERSION/README mismatches; blocks when any
  `.py` file under `ouroboros/` or `supervisor/` is added, modified, deleted, or renamed
  but no `tests/` file is staged; blocks when a new `.py` appears under those dirs but
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` is not staged as a non-deleted file — all before the expensive LLM call.
- **`pull_from_remote`**: fast-forward only pull from origin. Does NOT work when
  local and remote histories are unrelated (e.g. fresh app bundle vs full remote
  history) — use `rollback_to_target` for that case.
- **`rollback_to_target`**: reset current branch to any tag or commit SHA. Creates
  a rescue snapshot of uncommitted work first. Wraps `supervisor/git_ops.rollback_to_version()`.
  Equivalent to the UI "Restore" button in Evolution → Versions. Review-exempt: restores to
  an already-reviewed state. After the local `git reset --hard`, rollback now also does a
  best-effort `git push --force-with-lease origin <branch>` when `origin` exists and the
  branch diverges; if that remote sync fails, the rollback still succeeds locally but returns
  a `⚠️ Remote not synced` warning. Useful for syncing with remote after `pull_from_remote` fails
  due to unrelated histories: `pull_from_remote` (fetches), then
  `rollback_to_target(target="origin/ouroboros", confirm=true)`.
- **`restore_to_head`**: discard uncommitted changes (review-exempt)
- **`revert_commit`**: create a revert commit for a specific SHA (review-exempt)
- **Auto-tag**: on VERSION change, creates annotated tag `v{VERSION}` after tests pass
- **Auto-push**: best-effort push to origin after successful commit (non-fatal)
- **Credential helper**: `git_ops.configure_remote()` stores credentials in repo-local
  `.git/credentials`. `migrate_remote_credentials()` migrates legacy token-in-URL origins.
  Both are wired at startup and on settings save. Saving `GITHUB_TOKEN` + `GITHUB_REPO`
  in Settings automatically calls `configure_remote()`, so the remote is ready immediately
  after save — no restart required.

### Deterministic preflight checks (`_preflight_check` in `ouroboros/tools/review.py`)

Run before the expensive LLM review on every `repo_commit`. All 8 checks are
non-fatal on exception (LLM reviewers catch anything that slips through).

| # | Check | Triggers | Action |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | `version_readme_sync` | VERSION staged but README.md not staged | Block |
| 2 | `version_in_commit` | Commit message has version pattern but VERSION not staged | Block |
| 3 | `tests_affected` | `.py` files in `ouroboros/`/`supervisor/` changed without staged tests | Block |
| 4 | `architecture_doc` | New `.py` in `ouroboros/`/`supervisor/` but `ARCHITECTURE.md` not staged | Block |
| 5 | `version_values_match` | VERSION staged: pyproject.toml, README badge, ARCHITECTURE.md header in staged index must all match VERSION value | Block on mismatch |
| 6 | `readme_changelog_row` | VERSION staged: staged README.md changelog must have a table row for the new version | Block if missing |
| 7 | (reserved) | — | — |
| 8 | `conftest_no_tests` | `conftest.py` staged with `test_*` functions (AST parse of staged content, not regex/worktree read) | Block with move hint |

### Reviewer calibration (`CRITICAL_FINDING_CALIBRATION` in `ouroboros/tools/review_helpers.py`)

A shared calibration text block injected into triad reviewer prompts (`review.py`),
scope reviewer prompt (`scope_review.py`), and advisory reviewer prompt
(`claude_advisory_review.py`). A parallel condensed "Critical threshold rule"
subsection in `docs/CHECKLISTS.md` provides a summary for the checklist's own context.
Enforces: (1) exact repo-local artifact required before CRITICAL; (2) hypothetical/
plugin/env concerns → advisory; (3) one root cause = one FAIL; (4) do not hold
obligation open by abstracting a fixed concrete issue.

### Obligation accumulation (P3, `ouroboros/review_state.py::_update_obligations_from_attempt`)

Each critical finding is identified by a stable fingerprint `sha256(f"{item}:{reason}")[:12]`.
Every unique `(item, reason)` pair creates a **separate obligation** — obligations are never
merged or collapsed. LLMs rephrase reasons slightly across attempts, so the same root cause may
appear as multiple obligations with different fingerprints. This is intentional: deduplication
is the agent's responsibility via `review_rebuttal`, not code-level merging. An identical
finding repeated across attempts (same fingerprint) only updates the timestamp — reason
text stays stable.

`_resolve_matching_obligations` in `ouroboros/tools/claude_advisory_review.py` resolves
by both `obligation_id` (primary) and `item.lower()` (fallback for legacy saved state),
so the dual-path resolution handles obligations created under either scheme.

### Deterministic readiness gate (`ouroboros/tools/review_helpers.py::check_worktree_readiness`)

`check_worktree_readiness(repo_dir, paths)` runs cheap deterministic checks BEFORE the
expensive advisory SDK call. Returns a list of warning strings (empty = ready):
1. **No uncommitted changes** — blocking: if git status shows nothing to review, advisory
   returns an error immediately without calling the SDK.
2. **Version-sync warning** — delegates to `check_worktree_version_sync`.
3. **Python-without-tests warning** — if `.py` files under `ouroboros/` or `supervisor/` are
   modified but no `tests/` files are changed, emits a warning (non-blocking).
4. **Diff size warning** — warns if combined staged+unstaged diff exceeds advisory thresholds.

Called at the start of `_handle_advisory_pre_review`, before the `already_fresh` short-circuit.
Non-blocking warnings are emitted to `events.jsonl` as `advisory_readiness_gate` events.

### Shared worktree version-sync preflight (`ouroboros/tools/review_helpers.py::check_worktree_version_sync`)

`check_worktree_version_sync(repo_dir)` reads VERSION, pyproject.toml, README badge, and
ARCHITECTURE.md header from the **worktree** (before `git add`) and returns a warning string
on mismatch. The advisory path (`claude_advisory_review.py`) delegates to this shared helper
via a backward-compatible `_check_worktree_version_sync` alias. The staged-index equivalent
in `_preflight_check` (review.py) remains separate — it reads from `git show :PATH` after
staging and is the authoritative gate.

### Self-verification template (P2, `ouroboros/tools/review.py::_build_critical_block_message`)

From attempt ≥ 2, blocked commit messages include a structured self-verification
table requiring the agent to map each open finding to a status, evidence, and note
before calling `repo_commit` again. The same blocked message also adds explicit
re-audit guidance: after the first blocked review, re-read the full diff, group
obligations by root cause, rewrite the plan, then continue instead of patching one
finding at a time. Suppresses the "blind retry" pattern.

### Safety system (safety.py + registry.py)

Multi-layer security:
1. **Hardcoded sandbox** (registry.py): deterministic blocks on safety-critical file writes, mutative git via shell, GitHub repo/auth commands. Runs BEFORE any LLM check.
2. **Deterministic whitelist** (safety.py): known-safe operations (read-only shell commands, repo writes already guarded by sandbox) skip LLM for speed.
3. **LLM Layer 1 (fast)**: Light model checks remaining tool calls for SAFE/SUSPICIOUS/DANGEROUS.
4. **LLM Layer 2 (deep)**: If flagged, heavy model re-evaluates with "are you sure?" nudge.
5. **Post-execution revert**: After claude_code_edit, modifications to safety-critical files are automatically reverted.
- Safety LLM calls now emit standard `llm_usage` events, so safety costs and failures appear in the same audit/health pipeline as other model calls.
`identity.md` is intentionally mutable (self-creation) and can be rewritten radically;
the constitutional guard is that the file itself must remain non-deletable.

### Background consciousness (consciousness.py)

- Daemon thread, sleeps between wakeups (interval controlled by LLM via `set_next_wakeup`)
- Loads full agent context: BIBLE, **ARCHITECTURE.md** (v4.28.4+), identity, scratchpad, knowledge base, drive state,
  health invariants, recent chat/progress/tools/events (same context as main agent)
- Owner messages are forwarded to background consciousness in full text (not first-100-char previews).
- Calls LLM with lightweight introspection prompt
- Has limited tool access (memory, messaging, read-only; `schedule_task` is non-core and requires `enable_tools` if used)
- **Progress emission**: emits 💬 progress messages to UI via event queue + persists to `progress.jsonl`
- Pauses when regular task is running; deferred events queued and flushed on resume
- Budget-capped (default 10% of total)
- As of v4.29.4, background consciousness also reads the compact `Improvement Backlog` digest so it can groom, dedupe, or nominate existing backlog items without auto-starting implementation work.
- As of v4.29.4, CONSCIOUSNESS.md includes an 8-item rotating maintenance checklist (dialogue consolidation, identity freshness, scratchpad freshness, knowledge gaps, process-memory freshness, improvement backlog, tech radar, registry sync). One item is addressed per wakeup cycle.

### Block-wise dialogue consolidation (consolidator.py)

- Triggered after each task completion (non-blocking, runs in a daemon thread)
- Reads unprocessed entries from `chat.jsonl` in BLOCK_SIZE (100) message chunks
- Calls LLM (Gemini Flash) to create summary blocks stored in `dialogue_blocks.json`
- **Era compression**: when block count exceeds MAX_SUMMARY_BLOCKS (10), oldest blocks
  compressed into single "era summary" (30-40% of original length)
- **Auto-migration**: legacy `dialogue_summary.md` episodes auto-migrated to blocks
  on first consolidation run
- First-person narrative format ("I did...", "Anton asked...", "We decided...")
- Context reads blocks directly from `dialogue_blocks.json` instead of flat markdown

### Scratchpad auto-consolidation (consolidator.py)

- **Block-aware**: operates on `scratchpad_blocks.json` when blocks exist
- Triggered after each task when total block content exceeds 30,000 chars
- LLM extracts durable insights into knowledge base topics, compresses oldest blocks
- Falls back to flat-file mode for pre-migration scratchpads
- Writes knowledge files to `memory/knowledge/`, rebuilds `index-full.md`
- Uses platform-aware file locking to serialize concurrent calls
- Runs in a daemon thread (same pattern as dialogue consolidation)

### Execution reflection (reflection.py)

- Triggered at end of task when tool calls had errors or results contained
  blocking markers (`REVIEW_BLOCKED`, `TESTS_FAILED`, `COMMIT_BLOCKED`, etc.)
- Light LLM produces 150-250 word reflection capturing goal, errors, root cause, lessons
- Reflection prompt now includes structured review evidence (recent reviewed attempts,
  advisory runs, open obligations, live freshness, continuations) so blocked-review lessons
  affect process memory instead of collapsing into a generic failure note.
- Stored in `logs/task_reflections.jsonl`; last 20 entries loaded into dynamic context
- Pattern register: recurring error classes tracked in `memory/knowledge/patterns.md`
  via LLM, loaded into semi-stable context as "Known error patterns"
- Secondary reflection/pattern prompts use explicit truncation markers when compacted for prompt size; no silent clipping of these helper summaries.
- Runs synchronously (not in daemon thread) to avoid data loss on shutdown

### Crash report injection (agent.py)

- On startup, `_verify_system_state()` checks for `state/crash_report.json`
- If present, logs `crash_rollback_detected` event to `events.jsonl`
- File is NOT deleted — persists so `build_health_invariants()` surfaces
  CRITICAL: RECENT CRASH ROLLBACK on every task until the agent investigates

### Subtask lifecycle and trace summaries

- `schedule_task` now writes durable lifecycle states in `task_results/<id>.json`: `requested` → `scheduled` → `running` → terminal status (`completed`, `rejected_duplicate`, `failed`, etc.)
- Duplicate rejects are persisted explicitly, so `wait_for_task()` can report honest status instead of pretending the task is still running.
- Completed subtasks persist the full result text; parent tasks no longer see silently clipped child output.
- When a subtask completes, a compact trace summary is included alongside the full result.
- Task results also persist `review_evidence` so blocked-review history, obligations, and
  advisory state can feed summaries, reflections, and later diagnostics from the same durable record.
- Parent tasks see tool call counts, error counts, and agent notes.
- Trace compaction remains explicit: max 4000 chars with visible omission markers, plus first/last 15 tool calls for long traces.

### Context building (context.py)

- As of v3.16.0, the Memory Registry digest (from `memory/registry.md`) is injected into every LLM context to enable source-of-truth awareness.
- As of v3.20.0, `patterns.md` (Pattern Register) is injected into semi-stable context, and execution reflections from `task_reflections.jsonl` are injected into dynamic context.
- As of v4.29.4, `memory/knowledge/improvement-backlog.md` is maintained as a small durable advisory backlog. `agent_task_pipeline.py` nominates concrete follow-up items from execution reflections and structured review evidence after task completion, `context.py` injects only a compact digest into the dynamic block, and `consciousness.py` sees the same digest for grooming/nomination without auto-starting implementation.
- As of v3.22.0, all docs are always in static context: BIBLE.md (180k), ARCHITECTURE.md (60k), DEVELOPMENT.md (30k), README.md (10k), CHECKLISTS.md (5k).
- `Health Invariants` are placed at the start of the dynamic context block, before drive state/runtime/recent sections, so warnings influence planning before the model reads the noisier tail sections.
- Main task context now injects a dedicated `Review Continuity` section between runtime and recent-history sections:
  live repo gate status, stale markers, bypass reasons, open obligations, open review continuations,
  and the recent review ledger.
- `build_recent_sections()` keeps recent dialogue broad, but task-scopes recent progress/tools/events when `task_id` is available.
- `build_health_invariants()` is split into focused helpers and now also surfaces recent provider/routing errors plus local context overflows.
- Local-model path no longer silently slices the live system prompt. It compacts non-core sections explicitly and raises an overflow error if core context still cannot fit.

### Pre-implementation design review (plan_task)

- **Module**: `tools/plan_review.py`. Tool name: `plan_task`.
- **Purpose**: review a proposed implementation plan BEFORE writing any code. Call this
  for non-trivial tasks (>2 files or >50 lines of changes) to surface forgotten touchpoints,
  implicit contract violations, and simpler alternatives before the first edit.
- **Models**: uses the same 3 models from `OUROBOROS_REVIEW_MODELS` (same as commit triad).
  Falls back to repeating `OUROBOROS_MODEL` three times if unconfigured.
- **Inputs**: `plan` (description of what to change), `goal` (problem being solved), and
  optional `files_to_touch` (repo-relative paths whose HEAD content is injected for context).
- **Context per reviewer**: full repo pack (same as scope review — no char cap, binary/sensitive
  filtered via `build_full_repo_pack`) + HEAD snapshots of planned-touch files + "Plan Review
  Checklist" from `docs/CHECKLISTS.md` + BIBLE.md + DEVELOPMENT.md + ARCHITECTURE.md.
- **Checklist items**: completeness, correctness, minimalism, bible_alignment,
  implicit_contracts, testability, architecture_fit, forgotten_docs (8 items total).
- **Output format per reviewer**: verdict (PASS/RISK/FAIL) + detailed explanation + concrete fix
  (exact file/function/symbol) + alternative approaches if applicable. The system prompt also frames
  reviewers as validators of a concrete candidate plan rather than zero-based brainstormers: they are
  expected to challenge hidden assumptions, name missed boundaries/contracts, and explicitly say when
  the proposal should be narrowed.
- **Aggregate signal**: `GREEN` (proceed), `REVIEW_REQUIRED` (risks present), or `REVISE_PLAN` (FAILs found).
- **Non-blocking**: results are advisory only — the implementer decides what to do.
- **Budget gate**: if the assembled prompt exceeds `_PLAN_BUDGET_TOKEN_LIMIT` (1M tokens),
  review is skipped with a non-blocking `⚠️ PLAN_REVIEW_SKIPPED:` warning.
- **Cost**: ~$6-8 (3 × full-repo-pack reviewers, same cost as scope review × 3).
  Use for tasks where the alternative is 5+ blocked commits totaling $30-100.

### Review stack (advisory → triad + scope in parallel → commit)

The commit pipeline runs review stages before creating a git commit:

1. **Advisory pre-review** (`tools/claude_advisory_review.py` + `review_state.py`) — runs first, sequentially.
2. **Triad diff review** (`tools/review.py`) + **Blocking scope review** (`tools/scope_review.py`) — run **concurrently** via `ThreadPoolExecutor` (orchestrated in `tools/parallel_review.py`). Both execute on the same staged snapshot. The agent receives all findings (triad + scope) in a single blocking round.

Shared helpers live in `tools/review_helpers.py`: checklist section loader,
touched-file pack builder (`build_touched_file_pack`, 1MB file limit; sensitive files omitted case-insensitively before any read), full repo pack builder
(`build_full_repo_pack` — no char cap, binary/vendored/sensitive filtering, replaces deprecated
`build_broader_repo_pack`; excludes `jsonschema/`, `jsonschema_specifications/`, `Python.framework/`,
`certifi/`, the bare `Python` binary, and `tests/` in addition to the standard skip list —
untouched test files are excluded to reduce scope review prompt size; touched test files still arrive
via `build_touched_file_pack`), HEAD snapshot section builder, goal/scope resolution,
advisory SDK diagnostic helpers (`get_advisory_runtime_diagnostics`, `format_advisory_sdk_error`)
shared with `claude_advisory_review.py` to keep that module closer to the one-context-window target (P5).
`_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT` was raised from 100KB to 1MB in v4.13.0 to stop cutting off normal-sized files.

All LLM calls in the review stack (triad `_query_model`, scope `run_scope_review`) route through
the shared `LLMClient` from `ouroboros/llm.py` — the same layer used by the main agent. This ensures
cost events flow through the standard `llm_usage` audit pipeline, budget is tracked uniformly, and
errors surface via the same observability path.

#### Advisory pre-review gate

- **Worktree version-sync preflight**: `_check_worktree_version_sync` runs before the
  expensive SDK call. Reads VERSION, pyproject.toml, README badge, and ARCHITECTURE.md
  header from the worktree (not staged index — advisory runs before `git add`). If they
  disagree, a warning is emitted via `emit_progress_fn` and the advisory continues.
  Non-fatal and non-blocking; the staged-index equivalent in `repo_commit` preflight is
  the authoritative gate.
- **`advisory_pre_review`** tool: runs a read-only Claude Agent SDK review of the current
  worktree BEFORE `repo_commit`. Permitted tools: `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob` only (no Edit/Bash).
  **LLM-first parse fallback** (v4.24.0): when the SDK returns a narrative-style response where
  JSON findings appear after long reasoning text (common on large diffs), the structural JSON
  extractor may fail to find items. If `_parse_advisory_output()` returns empty but `raw_text`
  is non-empty, `_llm_extract_advisory_items()` makes a cheap call to `OUROBOROS_MODEL_LIGHT`
  (`no_proxy=True`, `reasoning_effort="low"`) asking the LLM to extract the JSON array from the
  narrative. Uses a head+tail window so JSON near the end of long responses is always included.
  This converts `parse_failure` → `fresh` run on the vast majority of real advisory outputs,
  saving $32–64 per bypass cycle.
  Model resolved via `resolve_claude_code_model()` — respects `CLAUDE_CODE_MODEL` setting,
  defaults to `opus` (same helper used by `claude_code_edit`). Shared Claude Code turn budget:
  50 turns for both advisory and edit paths. Per-tool timeout floor: 1200s (20 min).
  Prompt includes the "Repo Commit Checklist" section from
  CHECKLISTS.md (precise section loader), plus BIBLE.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, ARCHITECTURE.md,
  touched-file pack, goal/scope sections, git status, and worktree diff.
- **Advisory budget gate** (v4.15.0): if the assembled advisory prompt exceeds
  `_ADVISORY_PROMPT_MAX_CHARS` (~1.6M chars / ~400K tokens — Claude Code has a 1M token
  context, so 400K tokens leaves healthy headroom), advisory is skipped with a
  non-blocking `⚠️ ADVISORY_SKIPPED:` warning instead of timing out silently.
- **Obligation-based blocking history injection** (v4.12.0): when previous `repo_commit`
  calls were blocked, their `critical_findings` are accumulated as structured `ObligationItem`
  entries in durable state. When open obligations exist, the advisory prompt includes an
  "Unresolved obligations from previous blocking rounds" section listing each obligation by id,
  item, severity, and reason. Advisory MUST explicitly address each obligation by checklist item
  name — a generic PASS without addressing obligations is a weak signal (expected but not
  enforced at code level). Blocking history and open obligations are repo-scoped. The prompt
  section is omitted entirely when no obligations are open.
- **Obligation resolution**: `_resolve_matching_obligations()` runs on every parseable advisory
  result (regardless of whether other items fail). An obligation is marked resolved only when the
  advisory emits an unambiguous PASS for its checklist item (PASS present AND no FAIL for the same
  item in the same run). `on_successful_commit()` clears all obligations on a successful commit.
- **Auto-stale on edit** (v4.12.0): `_repo_write` and `_str_replace_editor` automatically call
  `mark_advisory_stale_after_edit()` after any successful worktree write, setting
  `last_stale_from_edit_ts` and marking all fresh/bypassed runs as stale. This was later generalized
  to repo-scoped invalidation after successful worktree mutations from `_repo_write`,
  `_str_replace_editor`, `claude_code_edit`, and mutating `run_shell` / commit paths.
  `add_run()` clears this flag when any advisory runs for the current snapshot (including `parse_failure`).
- **`review_status`** tool: read-only diagnostic showing advisory freshness, open obligations,
  staleness-from-edit, last commit attempt state, and a concrete next-step recommendation.
  Returns structured JSON with: `latest_advisory_status`, `latest_advisory_hash`, `stale_from_edit`,
  `open_obligations_count`, `next_step`, plus `last_commit_attempt` details when blocked/failed.
  When open obligations exist after a blocked review, the next-step guidance now explicitly
  instructs the agent to re-read the full diff, group obligations by root cause, rewrite the plan,
  and only then continue instead of patching one finding at a time.
- **`review_state.py`**: durable state. State file: `data/state/advisory_review.json`.
  Stores advisory runs plus a typed reviewed-attempt ledger, bounded blocking-attempt history,
  open obligations, stale markers, repo/tool/task identities, and reviewed-diff fingerprints.
  Advisory runs have: `snapshot_hash`, `commit_message`, `status`
  (fresh/stale/bypassed/skipped/parse_failure), `items`, `raw_result` (full, no truncation), audit fields,
  `snapshot_paths` (optional list of paths used to compute the scoped hash — `None` = whole repo),
  **forensic fields** `readiness_warnings` (list of warnings from the readiness gate),
  `prompt_chars` (size of the advisory prompt sent to the SDK), `model_used` (resolved Anthropic
  model name), `duration_sec` (wall-clock time for the SDK call).
  Commit attempts additionally carry **forensic fields** `triad_models` (list of 3 model IDs
  configured for the triad review) and `scope_model` (model ID configured for the scope review).
  These fields record the *configured* models at the time the review was launched, not necessarily
  the models that successfully responded — they are set before the LLM calls complete so they are
  always present even when a review attempt fails mid-flight. All forensic fields survive save/load
  via updated `_record_from_dict`/`_commit_attempt_from_dict` and are preserved across `_merge_attempt`
  calls so the latest values are never silently dropped on status updates.
  `parse_failure` means the SDK ran but returned unparseable output — repo_commit treats it as
  no fresh advisory (equivalent to stale) and requires a re-run or explicit bypass.
  `snapshot_paths` is persisted so `review_status` can recompute the live hash with the same
  path scope after a reload, preventing false staleness for path-scoped advisory runs.
  `is_fresh()` considers `status in ("fresh", "bypassed", "skipped")` — budget-gate skips
  are treated as valid coverage so the commit gate does not re-block after a non-blocking skip.
  Commit attempts have: `status` (reviewing/blocked/succeeded/failed), `block_reason`
  (no_advisory/critical_findings/review_quorum/parse_failure/infra_failure/scope_blocked/preflight/overlap_guard/revalidation_failed/fingerprint_unavailable),
  `block_details`, `duration_sec`, `critical_findings`, `advisory_findings`, `readiness_warnings`,
  `late_result_pending`, `pre_review_fingerprint`, `post_review_fingerprint`, `fingerprint_status`,
  `degraded_reasons`, and `(repo_key, tool_name, task_id, attempt)` identity.
  New fields: `blocking_history` (last 10 blocked attempts), `open_obligations` (list of
  `ObligationItem` with `obligation_id`, `item`, `severity`, `reason`, `source_attempt_ts`, `source_attempt_msg`, `status`, `resolved_by`, `repo_key`),
  `last_stale_from_edit_ts` / `last_stale_reason` / `last_stale_repo_key`, plus explicit lock-backed state updates.
  `add_blocking_attempt()` populates open obligations from `critical_findings`; `on_successful_commit()`
  clears all obligations. Advisory invalidation is repo-scoped and triggered automatically by successful
  mutations from `_repo_write`, `_str_replace_editor`, `claude_code_edit`, mutating `run_shell`, and
  reviewed commit flows when they change worktree state.
  **Forensic fields on terminal attempt records** (`triad_models`, `scope_model`): set by the reviewer
  orchestration layer immediately after resolving the configured model IDs and before awaiting LLM results.
  These fields are present on any terminal attempt record (`blocked`, `succeeded`, `failed`) where the
  review actually started. The initial `status="reviewing"` record written before the LLM calls begin
  may not carry these fields if the process terminates during review startup.
  From attempt >= 2, the blocked triad message built by `review.py::_build_critical_block_message`
  also includes a self-verification table plus explicit re-audit guidance: re-read the full diff,
  group obligations by root cause, rewrite the plan, then continue instead of patching one finding at a time.
- **`task_continuation.py`**: durable `data/state/review_continuations/<task_id>.json` payloads for blocked or interrupted review work.
  Built from durable review state, isolated per task, cleared only for the
  current task on successful reviewed commits, and surfaced on startup plus in
  `Review Continuity` context. Corrupt active payloads are quarantined under
  `review_continuations/corrupt/` so valid state can replace them without losing
  the corruption signal.
- **`review_evidence.py`**: structured collector that snapshots review ledger state, live advisory freshness,
  open obligations, and continuations into `task_results`, task summaries, and
  execution reflections. When `repo_dir` / `repo_key` is known, open obligations and stale markers stay
  repo-scoped; when `task_id` is present, `recent_attempts` stays task-scoped rather than silently
  falling back to another task's repo history.
  Output dict fields: `recent_attempts` (scoped commit attempts), `recent_advisory_runs` (repo-scoped),
  `open_obligations`, `continuations`, `corrupt_continuations`, `current_repo` (live advisory status),
  plus **omission counters** `omitted_attempts`, `omitted_advisory_runs`, `omitted_obligations`,
  `omitted_continuations` (count of entries trimmed by their respective `max_*` budget params),
  `omitted_corrupt` (count of corrupt continuation files beyond the fixed visible cap of 3), and
  **forensic fields** from attempt/run records: `triad_models`, `scope_model`, `readiness_warnings`,
  `prompt_chars`, `model_used`, `duration_sec` exposed via `_attempt_to_dict` and `_run_to_dict`.
  `has_evidence` is `True` when any visible list is non-empty, advisory_status is known, OR any
  omission counter is > 0 — including `omitted_corrupt` — so truncated evidence is never silently
  treated as absent. `max_attempts=0` / `max_runs=0` correctly returns an empty visible list with
  all entries counted as omitted (Python `[-0:]` full-slice bug is guarded explicitly).
- **Snapshot hash**: deterministic SHA-256 of changed file content digests only.
  Commit message is NOT part of the hash (decoupled for less brittle freshness).
  Path-aware: `paths` parameter scopes the hash to specific files.
- **Stale lifecycle**: when a new fresh run is added, all previous runs with different
  hashes are automatically marked stale. `mark_all_stale_except()` makes this real.
- **Goal/scope params**: `advisory_pre_review` accepts optional `goal`, `scope`, `paths`
  parameters for intent-aware review.
- **Gate integration**: both `_repo_commit_push` and `_repo_write_commit` check freshness.
- **Bypass**: `skip_advisory_pre_review=True` — durably audited in `events.jsonl`.
- **Auto-bypass on missing key**: records a `bypassed` run when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` absent.
- **No-truncation for results**: advisory run results stored in full (no `[:4000]` clipping).
  Diff >500K chars hard-fails before SDK call (returns `status="error"` immediately); diffs under 500K are passed in full without truncation.

#### Parallel triad + scope execution (v4.14.0)

- Triad review and scope review now run **concurrently** inside a `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2)`.
  Both launch on the same staged snapshot (git lock held). Wall-clock time is `max(triad_time, scope_time)`.
- Scope review now runs even when triad finds critical issues, so the agent still receives ALL findings
  (triad + scope) in a single blocking round instead of only seeing triad findings on first block.
  Exception: oversized full prompts trigger the budget gate, which skips scope review with a non-blocking warning.
- Results are aggregated: if both block, the combined message shows all findings with a note that both
  reviewers blocked. `block_reason` tracks the primary blocker (triad takes precedence if both block).
- `_scope_review_history` carries scope findings across retry rounds. Stored as `{snapshot_key: [entries]}` where `snapshot_key` is a SHA-256 prefix of the staged diff — findings from a prior blocked attempt on a different diff are not shown to the reviewer. Cleared to `{}` on a successful commit. Not in safety-critical registry.py (accessed via `getattr`).
- History snapshot taken before parallel launch so scope sees consistent state regardless of triad execution order.
- Applies to both `_repo_commit_push` and `_repo_write_commit` (legacy path).
- Orchestration logic extracted to `ouroboros/tools/parallel_review.py` (P5 Minimalism — relieves git.py size pressure).

#### Triad diff review (enriched)

- Three models review the staged diff against "Repo Commit Checklist" from CHECKLISTS.md.
- **Core governance artifacts**: reviewers receive BIBLE.md (constitutional preamble),
  **ARCHITECTURE.md** (full, via `_load_architecture_text` — first-class section, always
  present regardless of whether ARCHITECTURE.md was touched), and DEVELOPMENT.md (full,
  via `_load_dev_guide_text`). These are separate from the touched-file pack and are never
  gated on file-change status.
- **Full touched-file context**: reviewers see the complete current content of all changed
  files (via `build_touched_file_pack`), not just the patch hunks. Sensitive files (`.env`,
  `.pem`, `.key`, credentials files — case-insensitive) are omitted before reading. Binary
  and oversized (>1MB) files also produce explicit omission notes.
- **Goal section**: `build_goal_section` provides intended transformation context with
  precedence: goal > scope > commit_message > fallback. No raw task/chat text.
- **Shared reviewer calibration**: triad, scope, and advisory prompts all inject the same
  `CRITICAL_FINDING_CALIBRATION` text from `review_helpers.py`, so severity tuning (for example,
  keeping narrative README/count mismatches advisory while preserving release/safety invariants as
  critical) stays consistent across all three review surfaces.
- Enforcement configurable: `blocking` or `advisory`.

#### Blocking scope review

- **Module**: `tools/scope_review.py`. Single-model (configurable via `OUROBOROS_SCOPE_REVIEW_MODEL`, default `anthropic/claude-opus-4.6`). Reasoning effort via `OUROBOROS_EFFORT_SCOPE_REVIEW` (default `high`).
- **Fail-closed**: timeout, parse error, API failure, or unreadable touched files all block. Exception: when the fully assembled scope-review prompt (input only) exceeds `_SCOPE_BUDGET_TOKEN_LIMIT` (750K tokens), scope review is **skipped with a non-blocking advisory warning** rather than blocking the commit. The 750K gate is margin-aware: `estimate_tokens` (chars/4) under-counts by ~15%, so with 15% undercount `750K / 0.85 ≈ 882K` actual input tokens + 100K output = 982K < 1M API hard limit. Touched-file omission always takes precedence over the budget gate.
- **Role**: full-codebase reviewer with unique advantage — sees the ENTIRE repository,
  not just the diff. Finds cross-module bugs, broken implicit contracts, hidden
  regressions, and forgotten touchpoints that diff-only triad reviewers miss.
- **Prompt includes**: "Intent / Scope Review Checklist" from CHECKLISTS.md, touched-file
  pack, full repo pack (all tracked non-test files minus touched — no char cap, binary/vendored/sensitive
  filtered via `build_full_repo_pack`; `tests/` excluded from full repo pack to stay under the 1M-token
  budget gate — touched test files remain visible via `build_touched_file_pack`), goal/scope sections,
  DEVELOPMENT.md, staged diff, review history.
- **Pre-change (HEAD) snapshots** (best-effort): `build_head_snapshot_section` in `review_helpers.py`
  fetches the HEAD version of each touched file via `git show HEAD:<path>`. Sensitive files (`.env`,
  `.pem`, `.key`, `credentials.json`, etc. — case-insensitive) are suppressed before the subprocess
  call; their content never reaches review prompts or external models. Binary files (extension check +
  NUL/control-char/UTF-8-decode sniffer on raw bytes) and oversized files (>1MB raw bytes) are also
  omitted with explicit notes. New files get a "File is new" note; deleted/renamed files show old
  content. When a snapshot cannot be fetched (git timeout, git error), an explicit omission note is
  included. This enriches scope reviewer context but is not a hard gate — scope review proceeds even
  when individual snapshots are unavailable.
- **Full repo pack** (v4.13.0): `build_full_repo_pack` replaces the deprecated `build_broader_repo_pack`.
  No hardcoded char cap. Excludes: binary/media files (`_FULL_REPO_BINARY_EXTENSIONS`), vendored/minified
  (`.min.js`, `.min.css`, named vendored assets), sensitive files (`.env`, `.pem`, `.key`, etc.),
  oversized (>1MB), and directory prefixes `.cursor/`, `.github/`, `.vscode/`, `.idea/`, `assets/`,
  `webview/`. Explicit omission count appended when files are skipped.
- Checklist items (v4.14.1): 8 items including `cross_module_bugs` (does the change break something in a different module through implicit coupling?) and `implicit_contracts` (are there constants, data format assumptions, or expected signatures relied upon by other modules that this change violates?).
- **Budget gate**: after assembling the full scope-review prompt (input section only), token count is estimated via `estimate_tokens` (chars/4 heuristic). If the estimate exceeds `_SCOPE_BUDGET_TOKEN_LIMIT` (750K tokens), scope review is **skipped with a non-blocking warning** rather than crashing or sending an oversized request. The commit is not blocked in this case. The 750K gate is margin-aware: chars/4 under-counts by ~15%; `750K / 0.85 ≈ 882K` actual input + 100K output = 982K < 1M API limit.
- **`_TouchedContextStatus` dataclass** (v4.14.1): structured signal object used by `_build_scope_prompt()` to replace the old magic-string channel. `_compute_touched_status()` produces the touched-file statuses; `_build_scope_prompt()` creates `budget_exceeded` after estimating the assembled prompt. Fields: `status` ("empty"|"omitted"|"budget_exceeded"), `omitted_paths`, `token_count`. Success is represented by `context_status is None`, not a separate `"ok"` status. This prevents filename–sentinel collision (a real file named `__empty__` cannot be misclassified as a control sentinel).
- **Repo-pack gathering helper**: `_gather_scope_packs()` now only returns the wider repo-pack text (or raises on git failure). It no longer returns status sentinels.
- Runs **in parallel with** triad review (v4.14.0), BEFORE `git commit`. Also runs in `_repo_write_commit` (legacy path). Runs even when triad blocks — **except** when the budget gate skips it for an oversized assembled prompt.
- Respects review enforcement setting (blocking/advisory).

### Deep self-review (deep_self_review.py)

- Replaces the legacy `type="review"` task path with a dedicated deep review system.
- **Separate task type** (`deep_self_review`): bypasses the tool loop entirely — one direct LLM call.
- **Model**: `openai/gpt-5.4-pro` via OpenRouter (primary), or `openai::gpt-5.4-pro` via direct OpenAI (fallback). If neither key is configured, the review tool returns an availability error.
- **Review pack**: all git-tracked files (read from the git index via `dulwich` — pure Python, no subprocess) + a whitelist of core memory files (`identity.md`, `scratchpad.md`, `registry.md`, `WORLD.md`, `knowledge/index-full.md`, `knowledge/patterns.md`, `knowledge/improvement-backlog.md`). Does NOT include dialogue history, task reflections, or other operational logs — these would consume too much context without adding architectural insight.
- **macOS fork-safety**: when the Ouroboros app bundle uses `fork()` to spawn the inner `server.py` process, worker children inherit a multithreaded parent state. The first httpx HTTP request in a forked child triggers `SCDynamicStoreCopyProxiesWithOptions()` / `CFPreferences`, which is not fork-safe and causes a SIGSEGV (exit code -11, confirmed via `"crashed on child side of fork pre-exec"` in macOS crash reports). Fix: all worker-side LLM async calls (in `plan_review.py`, `review.py`, `scope_review.py`) pass `no_proxy=True` to `llm_client.chat_async()`. In `LLMClient.chat_async()`, when `no_proxy=True`, a one-shot `httpx.AsyncClient(trust_env=False, mounts={})` wrapped in an `AsyncOpenAI` client is created (closed in `finally`) for non-Anthropic providers; for Anthropic, `no_proxy=True` flows through to `_chat_anthropic()` which uses `requests.Session(trust_env=False)` instead of bare `requests.post()`. `_normalize_remote_response` is called with `skip_cost_fetch=True` when `no_proxy=True` to also suppress the `_fetch_generation_cost()` `requests.get()` call (which would re-introduce `SCDynamicStore` access on the OpenRouter path). The `deep_self_review` path uses `llm.chat(..., no_proxy=True)` via the synchronous `_chat_remote()` path. Regular task LLM calls use the shared cached client as before.
- **Excluded from pack**: sensitive files (`.env`, `.pem`, `.key`, etc.); vendored/minified third-party assets (`.min.js`, `.min.css`, bundled libraries such as `chart.umd.min.js`); binary and media files by extension (`_BINARY_EXTENSIONS`: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.ico`, `.svg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, fonts, compiled blobs) plus a content-based sniffer (`_is_probably_binary()`: NUL-byte presence OR >30% ASCII control-char ratio OR UTF-8 incremental decode failure — safe for Cyrillic/CJK, catches unlisted extensions like `.wasm`, `.bin`, extensionless blobs); excluded directory prefixes (`_SKIP_DIR_PREFIXES`: `assets/` — README screenshots and app icons; `webview/` — legacy PyWebView JS helpers); and files > 1MB. All exclusions appear in the `## OMITTED FILES` section of the review pack. The rule: deep review is for agent logic and its own prompts/docs — not for libraries, images, or operational runtime logs.
- **No chunking, no silent truncation**. All excluded files are listed in an `## OMITTED FILES` section appended to the review pack — visible to the model and the operator. If the total pack exceeds ~900K tokens, an explicit error is returned.
- **System prompt**: Constitution-first review mandate (BIBLE.md as absolute reference).
- **Invariants**: reasoning effort `high`, max_tokens `100000`, no tools, 1 round, 60-minute hard timeout.
- **Output**: full report to chat + saved to `memory/deep_review.md`.
- **Queue semantics**: `request_deep_self_review` tool → `deep_self_review_request` event → `queue_deep_self_review_task` → supervisor assigns to worker → `handle_task` branches on `task_type == "deep_self_review"`.
- **Slash command**: `/review` triggers a deep self-review.

### CI trigger tool (tools/ci.py)

- **`run_ci_tests`**: push current branch to GitHub and trigger the full CI matrix
  (Ubuntu + Windows + macOS) via `workflow_dispatch`.
- Uses **GitHub REST API** directly (`urllib.request`) — no `gh` CLI dependency.
- **Parameters**: `wait` (bool, default true — poll for results), `timeout_minutes` (1-30, default 15).
- **Requires**: `GITHUB_TOKEN` + `GITHUB_REPO` configured in Settings → Integrations.
- **Non-core tool**: available via `enable_tools("run_ci_tests")`, not loaded by default.
- **Workflow**: push branch → find `ci.yml` workflow ID → trigger `workflow_dispatch` →
  poll every 30s → return pass/fail with per-OS failure details and log tails.
- **Failure reporting**: on CI failure, fetches failed job list, identifies which OS failed,
  downloads job logs (last 5000 chars), and returns structured output.
- **Progress emission**: emits progress events to UI during push, trigger, and polling phases.
- **Use case**: agent triggers CI after platform-sensitive changes (process management,
  file locking, subprocess flags, new tool with native dependencies) to verify cross-platform
  compatibility before releasing. Not intended for every commit — agent decides when to run
  based on change characteristics.

## 8. Git Branching Model

- **ouroboros** — development branch. Agent commits here.
- **ouroboros-stable** — promoted stable version. Updated via "Promote to Stable" button.
- **main** — protected branch. Agent never touches it.

`safe_restart()` does `git checkout -f ouroboros` + `git reset --hard` on the repo.
Uncommitted changes are rescued to `~/Ouroboros/data/archive/rescue/` before reset.

---

## 8.1 CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

Three-tier GitHub Actions workflow:

| Tier | Trigger | What runs | Time |
|------|---------|-----------|------|
| Quick | Push to `ouroboros` (code paths only) | Ubuntu-only: `pytest` | ~1 min |
| Full | Push to `ouroboros-stable`, manual (`workflow_dispatch`), or tag `v*` | Matrix: Ubuntu + Windows + macOS: `pytest` | ~5 min |
| Build | Tag `v*` (after full-test passes) | Matrix: PyInstaller build → `.dmg` / `.tar.gz` / `.zip` + GitHub Release | ~15 min |

Path filters for branch pushes: `ouroboros/**`, `supervisor/**`, `server.py`, `tests/**`,
`web/**`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `.github/workflows/**`, `build.sh`,
`build_linux.sh`, `build_windows.ps1`, `Dockerfile`, `scripts/**`, `VERSION`, `README.md`.
Tag pushes (`v*`) always fire regardless of paths.

### Build scripts

| Script | Platform | Output |
|--------|----------|--------|
| `build.sh` | macOS | `dist/Ouroboros-{VERSION}.dmg` (optional signing + notarization) |
| `build_linux.sh` | Linux | `dist/Ouroboros-<VERSION>-linux-<arch>.tar.gz` |
| `build_windows.ps1` | Windows | `dist/Ouroboros-<VERSION>-windows-x64.zip` |

All three use PyInstaller with `server.py` as entry point. Hidden imports cover
starlette, uvicorn, websockets, dulwich, huggingface_hub. Data bundles include
`ouroboros/`, `supervisor/`, `web/`, `prompts/`, `docs/`, `assets/`, `BIBLE.md`,
`README.md`, `VERSION`, `pyproject.toml`.

### Docker (`Dockerfile`)

```
python:3.10-slim + git → pip install requirements → python server.py
Binds 0.0.0.0:8765, sets OUROBOROS_FILE_BROWSER_DEFAULT=/app.
```

## 9. Shutdown & Process Cleanup

**Requirement: closing the window (X button or Cmd+Q) MUST leave zero orphan
processes. No zombies, no workers lingering in background.**

### 9.1 Normal Shutdown (window close)

```
1. _shutdown_event.set()           ← signal lifecycle loop to exit
2. stop_agent()
   a. SIGTERM → server.py          ← server runs its lifespan shutdown:
      │                                kill_workers(force=True) → SIGTERM+SIGKILL all workers
      │                                then server exits cleanly
   b. wait 10s for exit
   c. if still alive → SIGKILL     ← hard kill (workers may orphan)
3. _kill_orphaned_children()        ← SAFETY NET
   a. _kill_stale_on_port(8765)    ← lsof port, SIGKILL any survivors
   b. multiprocessing.active_children() → SIGKILL each
4. release_pid_lock()               ← delete ~/Ouroboros/ouroboros.pid
```

This three-layer approach (graceful → force-kill server → sweep port/children)
guarantees no orphans even if the server hangs or workers resist SIGTERM.

### 9.2 Panic Stop (`/panic` command or Panic Stop button)

**Panic is a full emergency stop. Not a restart — a complete shutdown.**

The panic sequence (in `server.py:_execute_panic_stop()`):

```
1. consciousness.stop()             ← stop background consciousness thread
2. Save state: evolution_mode_enabled=False, bg_consciousness_enabled=False
3. Write ~/Ouroboros/data/state/panic_stop.flag
4. LocalModelManager.stop_server()   ← kill local model server if running
5. kill_all_tracked_subprocesses()   ← os.killpg(SIGKILL) every tracked
   │                                    subprocess process group (SDK agent,
   │                                    shell commands, and ALL their children)
6. kill_workers(force=True)          ← SIGTERM+SIGKILL all multiprocessing workers
7. os._exit(99)                      ← immediate hard exit, kills daemon threads
```

Launcher handles exit code 99:

```
7. Launcher detects exit_code == PANIC_EXIT_CODE (99)
8. _shutdown_event.set()
9. Kill orphaned children (port sweep + multiprocessing sweep)
10. _webview_window.destroy()        ← closes PyWebView, app exits
```

On next manual launch:

```
11. auto_resume_after_restart() checks for panic_stop.flag
12. Flag found → skip auto-resume, delete flag
13. Agent waits for user interaction (no automatic work)
```

### 9.3 Subprocess Process Group Management

All subprocesses spawned by agent tools (`run_shell`, `claude_code_edit`)
use `start_new_session=True` (via `_tracked_subprocess_run()` in
`ouroboros/tools/shell.py`). This creates a separate process group for each
subprocess and all its children.

On panic or timeout, the entire process tree is killed via
`os.killpg(pgid, SIGKILL)` — no orphans possible, even for deeply nested
subprocess trees (e.g., SDK agent processes spawned during `claude_code_edit`).

Active subprocesses are tracked in a thread-safe global set and cleaned up
automatically on completion or via `kill_all_tracked_subprocesses()` on panic.
`run_shell` surfaces timeout-vs-signal distinctions in its result text so
`exit_code=-9` no longer looks like a silent success in summaries/reflections.

## 10. Key Invariants

1. **Never delete BIBLE.md. Never physically delete `identity.md` file.**
   (`identity.md` content is intentionally mutable and may be radically rewritten.)
2. **VERSION == pyproject.toml version == latest git tag == README version == ARCHITECTURE.md header version**
3. **Config SSOT**: all settings defaults and paths live in `ouroboros/config.py`
4. **Message bus SSOT**: all messaging goes through `supervisor/message_bus.py`
5. **State locking**: `state.json` uses file locks for concurrent read-modify-write
6. **Budget tracking**: per-LLM-call cost events with model/key/category breakdown
7. **Core file sync**: safety-critical files are overwritten from bundle on every launch
8. **Zero orphans on close**: shutdown MUST kill all child processes (see Section 9)
9. **Panic MUST kill everything**: all processes (workers, subprocesses, subprocess
   trees, consciousness, evolution) are killed and the application exits completely.
   No agent code may prevent or delay panic. See BIBLE.md Emergency Stop Invariant.
10. **Architecture documentation**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` must be kept in sync with
    the codebase. Every structural change (new module, new API endpoint, new data file,
    new UI page) must be reflected here. This is the single source of truth for how
    the system works.
